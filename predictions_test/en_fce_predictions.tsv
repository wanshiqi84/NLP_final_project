will	c
make	c

As	c
nights	c
may	c
be	c
cold	c
at	c
this	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
,	c
may	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
take	c
with	c
you	c
a	c
pullover	c
.	c

Appart	i
of	c
that	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
recommendation	c
as	c
to	c
what	c
to	c
wear	c
.	c

Depending	c
on	c
the	c
interests	c
of	c
your	c
students	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
visit	c
the	c
internet	i
site	c
of	c
the	c
tourist	c
office	c
:	c
www.neuchatel.ch	c
.	c

yours	c
sincerely	c

Where	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

is	c
very	c
often	c
the	c
first	c
question	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
asked	c
when	c
answering	c
the	c
phone	c
.	c

Why	c
?	c

Because	c
somebody	c
has	c
invented	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
communication	c
device	c
ever	c
.	c

The	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

Once	c
heavy	c
,	c
expensive	c
and	c
not	c
reliable	c
,	c
the	c
new	c
mobile	c
phone	c
fits	c
in	c
almost	c
any	c
pocket	c
and	c
is	c
given	c
away	c
by	c
the	c
operator	c
to	c
attract	c
new	c
customers	c
.	c

Due	c
to	c
the	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

communication	c
has	c
changed	c
,	c
not	c
improved	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
it	c
allows	c
to	c
be	c
reached	c
everywhere	c
(	c
even	c
in	c
places	c
you	c
would	c
n't	c
want	c
.	c
)	c

For	c
rescue	c
teams	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
help	c
.	c

But	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
a	c
handicap	c
outside	c
professional	c
life	c
.	c

Should	c
n't	c
people	c
communicate	c
with	c
those	c
they	c
are	c
next	c
to	c
instead	c
of	c
calling	c
someone	c
2	c
miles	c
away	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
rare	c
to	c
see	c
two	c
people	c
walking	c
side	c
by	c
side	c
,	c
both	c
talking	c
on	c
the	c
phone	c
.	c

Would	c
n't	c
it	c
be	c
better	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
shopping	c
list	c
instead	c
of	c
dialing	c
home	c
to	c
ask	c
which	c
salad	c
to	c
buy	c
.	c

Mobile	c
phone	c
is	c
a	c
marvellous	c
invention	c
but	c
as	c
for	c
cigarettes	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
right	c
on	c
it	c

CAUTION	c

Dear	c

I	c
am	c

June	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
group	c
has	c
been	c
booked	c
into	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
,	c
which	c
locates	c
beside	c
the	c
congress	c
house	c
in	c
the	c
centre	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
make	c
contact	c
with	c
Mrs	c
Brackenbury	c
using	c
the	c
number	c
06	c
8793888	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
from	c
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
is	c
to	c
take	c
the	c
bus	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
specially	c
organized	c
by	c
us	c
.	c

The	c
bus	c
leaves	c
at	c
8:00	c
every	c
morning	c
and	c
gets	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
hotel	c
at	c
6	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

Off	c
course	c
there	c
's	c
also	c
a	c
bus	c
number	c
8	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
hotel	c
is	c
also	c
suitable	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
leaves	c
only	c
every	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

The	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
,	c
which	c
happens	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
on	c
20	c
June	c
,	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
held	c
on	c
the	c
coast	c
.	c

Beside	c
the	c
barbecue	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
well	c
-	c
known	c
student	c
bands	c
from	c
our	c
country	c
are	c
performing	c
music	c
through	c
the	c
whole	c
night	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
more	c
is	c
,	c
that	c
there	c
's	c
a	c
Latin	c
music	c
band	c
coming	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
party	c
more	c
colourful	c
.	c

It	c
plays	c
from	c
10:00	c
to	c
11:00	c
,	c
while	c
the	c
students	c
can	c
enjoy	c
it	c
with	c
dancing	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
events	c
of	c
the	c
party	c
will	c
end	c
up	c
at	c
about	c
12:30	c
in	c
the	c
night	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
see	c
,	c
what	c
to	c
wear	c
is	c
just	c
something	c
casual	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
afternoon	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
museums	c
,	c
markets	i
(	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
robot	c
-	c
market	c
)	c
.	c

Basically	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
free	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
students	c
to	c
look	c
round	c
here	c
by	c
themselves	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
your	c
questions	c
re	c
answered	c
appropriatly	i

I	c
'm	c
looking	c

Computer	c
Life	c

Now	c
-	c
a	c
-	c
day	c
computer	c
can	c
be	c
found	c
in	c
almost	c
every	c
corner	c
,	c
in	c
offices	c
,	c
in	c
shops	c
.	c

Or	c
even	c
in	c
cars	c
and	c
washmachines	c
there	c
're	c
computer	c
chips	c
.	c

What	c
has	c
computer	c
affected	c
to	c
our	c
life	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
efficiency	c
of	c
the	c
society	c
has	c
been	c
improved	c
.	c

When	c
shopping	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
wait	c
the	c
Kasse	c
to	c
take	c
every	c
article	c
's	c
note	c
by	c
hand	c
.	c

When	c
booking	c
a	c
airline	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
just	c
simply	c
make	c
a	c
phone	c
to	c
any	c
agency	c
,	c
and	c
get	c
it	c
done	c
in	c
one	c
minute	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
looking	c
up	c
tons	i
of	c
books	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
information	c
what	c
we	c
need	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
very	c
easily	c
search	c
it	c
from	c
internet	i
or	c
on	c
the	c
local	c
network	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
very	c
often	c
heard	c
,	c
that	c
someone	c
,	c
who	c
has	c
a	c
special	c
illness	c
,	c
gets	c
operations	c
by	c
a	c
foreign	c
institutes	c
,	c
which	c
he	c
find	c
via	c
internet	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
with	c
computer	c
network	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
possible	c
that	c
people	c
work	c
from	c
home	c
,	c
making	c
projects	c
,	c
controling	i
operations	c
or	c
having	c
conferences	c
.	c

Lastly	c
the	c
way	c
of	c
communications	c
has	c
been	c
also	c
changed	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
the	c
tranditional	c
telecommunication	i
,	c
we	c
can	c
talk	c
,	c
mail	c
or	c
even	c
see	i
each	c
other	c
with	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
computer	c
network	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
there	c
're	c
also	c
some	c
aspects	c
in	c
which	c
the	c
computer	c
technology	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
improved	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
reading	c
on	c
the	c
screen	c
is	c
still	c
not	c
as	c
comfortable	c
as	c
on	c
papers	c
.	c

A	c
very	c
important	c
and	c
severe	c
problem	c
is	c
the	c
reliability	c
and	c
security	c
.	c

Till	c
now	c
,	c
to	c
completely	c
rely	c
on	c
computer	c
is	c
still	c
somehow	c
not	c
safe	c
enough	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
computer	c
have	c
become	c
a	c
very	c
essential	c
necessity	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
still	c
a	c
young	c
invention	c
,	c
which	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
improved	c
.	c

Dear	c
Maria	c

First	c
at	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sorry	c
about	c
Richard	c
illness	c

Please	c
remember	c
me	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
give	c
him	c
my	c
best	c
wishes	c
.	c

About	c
your	c
request	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
must	c
need	c
,	c
however	c
you	c
can	c
call	c
me	c
if	c
you	c
consider	c
it	c
necessary	c
,	c
(	c
my	c
phone	c
number	c
is	c
2496	c
9731	c
)	c
.	c

Your	c
group	c
has	c
been	c
booked	c
into	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
.	c

Because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
wellkown	c
hotel	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
easy	c
to	c
find	c
it	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
well	c
-	c
located	c
so	c
it	c
will	c
allow	c
you	c
to	c
move	c
around	c
the	c
city	c
without	c
any	c
problem	c
.	c

Even	c
more	c
the	c
conference	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
Exhibition	c
Centre	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
located	c
only	c
five	c
minutes	c
walking	c
far	c
from	c
the	c
Hotel	c
.	c

We	c
haven't	c
asked	c
for	c
any	c
special	c
clothes	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
wear	c
casual	c
and	c
comfortable	c
clothes	c
,	c
although	c
you	c
can	c
come	c
well	c
-	c
dressed	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
feel	c
better	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
conference	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
an	c
informal	c
dinner	c
with	c
a	c
previous	c
snack	c
time	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
introduce	i
each	c
others	i
.	c

Finally	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
visit	c
the	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
take	c
you	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
hours	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
a	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
charge	c
for	c
organise	c
the	c
conference	c
in	c
my	c
college	c
.	c
Do	c
not	c
worry	c
if	c
Richard	c
did	c
not	c
left	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
pleased	c
to	c
help	c
you	c
.	c

We	c
looked	c
in	c
every	c
hotel	c
in	c
Town	c
trying	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
best	c
offerd	c
.	c

We	c
found	c
two	c
good	c
hotels	c
but	c
we	c
decided	c
for	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
.	c

This	c
has	c
the	c
best	c
price	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
find	c
.	c

The	c
conference	c
day	c
our	c
school	c
driver	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
pick	c
you	c
up	c
in	c
the	c
hotel	c
and	c
take	c
you	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c

going	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
local	c
discotheque	c
near	c
the	c
college	c
so	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
is	c
walking	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
any	c
special	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
but	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
you	c
can	c
wear	c
very	c
cassual	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
I	c
sugget	c
you	c
to	c
go	c
to	c

can	c
enjoy	c

and	c
looking	c
around	c

Yours	c

Yours	c

The	c
telephone	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
invention	c
,	c
which	c
has	c
affected	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
way	c
for	c
people	c
to	c
communicate	c
although	c
they	c
are	c
at	c
two	c
different	c
places	c
.	c

People	c
use	c
the	c
telephone	c
every	c
day	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
things	c
in	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
people	c
need	c
a	c
telephone	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
a	c
telephone	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
in	c
job	c
-	c
life	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
there	c
are	c
no	c
companies	c
which	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
telephone	c
.	c

Also	c
it	c
is	c
god	c
for	c
people	c
's	c
safety	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
call	c
the	c
police	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
danger	c
or	c
the	c
ambulance	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
injured	c
.	c

The	c
people	c
use	c
the	c
telephone	c
also	c
for	c
their	c
personal	c
life	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
your	c
family	c
or	c
to	c
your	c
friends	c
who	c
live	c
far	c
away	c
.	c

Another	c
aspect	c
is	c
that	c
people	c
have	c
more	c
time	c
if	c
they	c
have	c
a	c
telephone	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
give	c
and	c
receive	c
informations	i
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

This	c
invention	c
has	c
made	c
our	c
lives	c
easier	c
and	c
quickier	c
.	c

The	c
telephone	c
has	c
made	c
my	c
own	c
life	c
also	c
easy	c
and	c
quick	i
.	c

It	c
makes	c
something	c
possible	c
you	c
can	c
not	c
do	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
telephone	c
is	c
very	c
efficient	c
for	c
people	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
concerning	c
the	c
international	c
student	c
conference	c
in	c
our	c
college	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
get	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
are	c
requested	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
booked	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
for	c
your	c
group	c
.	c

This	c
hotel	c
is	c
quiet	c
and	c
near	c
the	c
conference	c
building	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
suggest	c
going	c
by	c
bus	c
from	c
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
convenient	c
form	c
of	c
transport	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
as	c
usually	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
organise	c
a	c
party	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
conference	c
,	c
therefore	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
if	c
your	c
students	c
wear	c
a	c
suit	c
(	c
for	c
man	c
)	c
or	c
a	c
skirt	c
(	c
for	c
woman	c
)	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
this	c
party	c
would	c
be	c
in	c
your	c
hotel	c
like	c
the	c
following	c
years	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
mouseum	c
is	c
our	c
town	c

I	c
would	c

to	c
the	c
frogs	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
can	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

At	c
First	c
,	c
this	c
international	c
student	c
conference	c
has	c
the	c
intension	c
of	c
explain	c
to	c
students	c
how	c
important	c
is	c
the	c
education	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
we	c
choose	c
the	c
luxuery	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
which	c
is	c
comfortable	c
enough	c
and	c
in	c
a	c
good	c
location	c
.	c

The	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
is	c
located	c
in	c
the	c
centre	c
of	c
the	c
city	c

so	c
you	c
can	c
go	c
by	c
train	c
,	c
by	c
bus	c
or	c
by	c
car	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
should	c
go	c
by	c
train	c
and	c
go	c
out	c
in	c
the	c
Museum	c
Station	c

The	c
Conference	c
will	c
happen	c
in	c
the	c
Hotel	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
so	c
much	c
easier	c
.	c

The	c
Conference	c
,	c
not	c
being	c
modest	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
quite	c
well	c
organized	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
starts	c
at	c
eight	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
will	c
finish	c
around	c
five	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
should	c
wear	c
something	c
informal	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
make	c
things	c
as	c
more	c
comfortable	c
as	c
possible	c
to	c
our	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
my	c
area	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
an	c
afternoon	c
is	c
not	c
enough	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
call	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
show	c
you	c
some	c
interesting	c
places	c
.	c
I	c
will	c

Affecting	c
Our	c
Lifes	i

Cars	c
,	c
boats	c
,	c
motobikes	c
,	c
airplanes	i
:	c
Who	c
did	c
never	c
use	i
this	i
once	c
?	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
question	c
.	c

The	c
humans	c
seems	c
always	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
running	c
and	c
the	c
fastest	c
of	c
this	c
inventions	c
is	c
certainly	c
,	c
the	c
airplane	c
.	c

At	c
First	c
,	c
when	c
Santos	c
Dummont	c
invented	c
the	c
airplane	c
,	c
he	c
probably	c
did	c
n't	c
think	c
how	c
the	c
people	c
could	c
transform	c
his	c
creation	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
world	c
,	c
where	c
the	c
nations	c
fight	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
better	c
one	c
could	c
n't	c
be	c
diferent	i
:	c
the	c
airplane	c
became	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
in	c
the	c
war	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
used	c
to	c
kill	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
invention	c
of	c
the	c
airplane	c
has	c
brought	c
us	c
some	c
facilities	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
a	c
person	c
come	c
from	c
Brazil	c
to	c
Australia	c
?	c

Maybe	c
by	c
boat	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
could	c
take	c
too	c
long	c
!	c

The	c
best	c
way	c
is	c
definetely	i
,	c
by	c
air	c
.	c

After	c
this	c
invention	c
travel	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
is	c
so	c
much	c
easier	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
thanks	c
and	c
congratulate	c
all	c
the	c
creators	i
who	c
invented	i
facility	i
things	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
the	c
airplane	c
is	c
definitely	c
an	c
important	c
invention	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
have	c
changed	c
people	c
's	c
life	c
in	c
wars	c
.	c

Until	c
now	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
being	c
important	c
in	c
the	c
transport	c
of	c
thousands	c
and	c
thousands	c
of	c
people	c
around	c

TELEVISION	c

What	c
would	c
our	c

be	c
without	c

It	c
is	c
n't	c
easy	c
giving	c
an	c
answer	c
at	c
this	c

Television	c
is	c
an	c

to	c
better	c
our	c
way	c

This	c

a	c

all	c
around	c

what	c

to	c
do	c
is	c
watching	c

And	c
we	c
like	c
that	c

because	c
it	c
's	c
easier	c
nothing	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Wolf	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
question	c
about	c
the	c
information	c
on	c
an	c
interesting	c
building	c
to	c
visit	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
introduce	c
one	c
building	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

\"	c
Sky	c
Heaven	c
\"	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
name	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
,	c
is	c
for	c
fifteen	c
minutes	c
from	c
the	c
centre	c
of	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

This	c
building	c
have	c
a	c
hundred	c
floor	c
and	c
it	c
takes	c
for	c
five	c
minutes	c
from	c
the	c
grand	i
to	i
the	c
top	c
in	c
the	c
elevator	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
facilities	c
which	c
are	c
a	c
museum	c
,	c
a	c
exhibition	c
and	c
many	c
gift	c
shops	c
where	c
we	c
might	c
also	c
enjoy	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
for	c
my	c
recommendation	c
is	c
that	c
Sky	c
Heaven	c
is	c
the	c
highest	c
building	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
get	c
the	c
top	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
and	c
experience	c
such	c
a	c
amazing	c
view	c
.	c

Another	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
museum	c
,	c
which	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
history	c
of	c
my	c
town	c
so	c
easily	c
and	c
clearly	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
experience	c
for	c
your	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
accept	c
my	c
recommendation	c
and	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c

from	c
you	c

more	c

how	c
to	c
drive	c
and	c
choose	c
to	c
travel	c

it	c
saves	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
comper	c
to	c
travelling	c
by	c
public	c
transport	c

Cars	c
are	c
also	c
more	c
reliable	c
than	c
other	c
types	c
of	c

to	c
comment	c
on	i
this	c

From	c
my	c
personal	c
experience	c
I	c
realised	c
how	c
it	c
's	c
important	c
to	c
drive	c
a	c
car	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
living	c
in	c
Johanesburg	c
in	c
South	c
Africa	c
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
there	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
when	c
my	c
daughter	c
was	c
only	c
4	c
months	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
drive	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

Johanesburg	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
dangerous	c
place	c
to	c
live	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
just	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
walk	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
dangerous	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
public	c
transport	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
complex	c
where	c
we	c
lived	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
relay	c
on	c
other	c
people	c
to	c
take	c
me	c
to	c
a	c
shop	c
or	c
the	c
doctors	c
or	c
anywhere	c
else	c
.	c

There	c
I	c
soon	c
realised	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
drive	c
if	c
I	c
wanted	c
a	c
quality	c
life	c
for	c
my	c
daughter	c
and	c
myself	c

Since	c
I	c
passed	c
my	c
driving	c
test	c
I	c
can	c
not	c
understand	c
how	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
a	c
car	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
use	c
my	c
car	c
every	c
day	c
everywhere	c
I	c
go	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
an	c
international	c
student	c
conference	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
hotel	c
which	c
the	c
group	c
has	c
been	c
booked	c
into	c
is	c
The	c
Princes	c
Hotel	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
near	c
York	c
Railway	c
Station	c
which	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
there	c
easily	c
.	c

By	c
rail	c
:	c
get	c
off	c
at	c
York	c
station	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
walk	c
from	c
the	c
station	c
turn	c
left	c
and	c
the	c
hotel	c
is	c
on	c
your	c
left	c
hand	c
side	c
.	c

By	c
bus	c
:	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
buses	c
in	c
York	c
City	c
Centre	c
pass	c
the	c
station	c
,	c
or	c
you	c
can	c
take	c
a	c
taxi	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
conference	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
event	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
,	c
we	c
agree	c
to	c
wear	c
formal	c
dresses	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
men	c
should	c
wear	c
suits	c
,	c
ties	c
and	c
the	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
,	c
we	c
also	c
have	c
a	c
country	c
dancing	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
special	c
because	c
all	c
the	c
dancers	c
are	c
from	c
our	c
group	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
we	c
have	c
an	c
afternoon	c
free	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
If	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
walk	c
around	c
the	c
city	c
of	c
York	c
and	c
visit	c
the	c
historic	c
buildings	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
could	c
think	c
of	c
any	c
other	c
ideas	c
It	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
kind	c
of	c
you	c
.	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
my	c
idea	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
could	c
help	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Inventions	c
have	c
affected	c
all	c
our	c
lives	c
!	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
are	c
invented	c
and	c
make	c
our	c
lives	c
are	c
more	c
convenient	c
than	c
those	c
days	c
.	c

A	c
car	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
invention	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
a	c
car	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
to	c
me	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
convenient	c
for	c
everyday	c
life	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
to	c
many	c
places	c
in	c
the	c
U.K.	i
Especially	c
,	c
I	c
live	i
in	c
Whitwell	i
-	c
on	i
-	c
the	c
-	c
Hill	c
(	c
a	c
village	c
near	c
Malton	c
in	c
North	c
Yorkshire	c
)	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
got	c
a	c
car	c
how	c
could	c
I	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
go	c
to	c
college	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
?	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
buses	c
(	c
number	c
843	c
and	c
845	c
)	c
which	c
go	c
pass	c
my	c
village	c
but	c
the	c
bus	c
fares	c
is	c
very	c
expensive	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
it	c
takes	c
long	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
somewhere	c
.	c

The	c
car	c
has	c
largely	c
affected	c
my	c
own	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
go	c
anywhere	c
by	c
car	c
a	c
lot	c
quicker	c
than	c
use	c
public	i
transports	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
listen	c
to	c
the	c
radio	c
and	c
sometimes	c
can	c
listen	c
to	c
Thai	c
music	c
which	c
I	c
brought	c
some	c
cassets	c
with	c
me	c
from	c
Thailand	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
a	c
car	c
driving	c
theory	c
test	c
last	c
October	c
and	c
I	c
passed	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
take	c
a	c
pratice	i
driving	c
test	c
very	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
drive	c
the	c
car	c
myself	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
know	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
advantages	c
of	c
using	c
the	c
car	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
car	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
to	c
me	c
and	c
it	c
has	c
affected	c
my	c
own	c
life	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
have	c
more	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
buy	c
another	c
car	c
.	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
has	c
more	c
advantages	c
than	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
say	c
many	c
thanks	c
to	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
invented	c
a	c
car	c

Dear	c
Maria	c
Smith	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c

your	c

the	c
first	c

July	c
.	c

The	c
hotel	c

was	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c

When	c
you	c

catch	c
the	c

37	c
which	c
will	c
go	c
to	c
town	c
center	i
.	c

From	c
there	c
you	c
will	c
walk	c
until	c
the	c
college	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
easier	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
than	c
to	c
get	c
with	c
another	c

Anyway	c

is	c
the	c
unique	c
old	c

the	c
top	c
of	c
the	c
town	c
's	c
hill	c
.	c

This	c
place	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
because	c

that	c
an	c

the	c

History	c

.	c

They	c
decided	c
to	c
build	c
more	c
school	c
specially	c
in	c
Switzerland	c
because	c
the	c
people	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Maria	c
Smith	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answering	c
our	c
question	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
already	c
have	c
booked	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
for	c
the	c
students	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
the	c
hotel	c
near	c
my	c
college	c
.	c

It	c
takes	c
five	c
minutes	c
to	c
get	c
my	c
college	c
by	c
walking	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
copy	c
the	c
map	c
around	c
the	c
college	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
start	c
at	c
six	c
o'clock	c
.	c

The	c
party	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
in	c
the	c
dinning	c
room	c
.	c

People	c
who	c
will	c
attend	c
the	c
party	c
are	c
many	c
professers	c
,	c
semi	i
-	c
professers	c
and	c
faculties	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
the	c
students	c
should	c
wear	c
formal	c
clothes	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
ideas	c
for	c
an	c
afternoon	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
city	c
in	c
which	c
there	c
is	c
my	c
college	c
is	c
traditional	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
shrines	c
,	c
temples	i
,	c
and	c
castles	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
visit	c
these	c
places	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
other	c
colleges	i
.	c

You	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
see	c
many	c
Japanese	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
at	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
gain	c
more	c
information	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
ask	c
me	c
everytime	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
visit	c
one	c
building	c
.	c

My	c
town	c
is	c
the	c
capital	c
of	c
Japan	c
.	c

So	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
higher	c
buildings	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
like	c
New	c
York	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
only	c
one	c
building	c
which	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
visit	c
.	c

The	c
name	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
is	c
'	c
Sunshine	c
60	c
'	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
highest	c
building	c
in	c
Tokyo	c
.	c
I	c
recommend	c
to	c
visit	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
three	c
reasons	c
for	c
my	c
recommendation	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
the	c
acquerium	c
in	c
the	c
building	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
60th	c
floor	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believed	c
it	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
visit	c
there	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
see	c
everywhere	c
in	c
Tokyo	c
.	c

The	c
scene	i
of	c
Tokyo	c
is	c
not	c
beautiful	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
city	c
is	c
a	c
developing	c
place	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
you	c
may	c
think	c
what	c
a	c
small	c
city	c
it	c
is	c
!	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
shops	c
inside	c
the	c
building	c
.	c
You	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
for	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
when	c
you	c
visit	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
favorite	i
place	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
visit	c
there	c
.	c

,	c
taking	c
20	c
minutes	c
by	c
car	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
taxi	c
from	c
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
the	c
college	c

of	c
your	c

are	c
4	c
and	c
taxi	c
fare	c
would	c
not	c
be	c
expensive	c

There	c
is	c
a	c

You	c
can	c
wear	c
either	c
casual	c
dresses	c

because	c
we	c

and	c
the	c
raffle	c

The	c
other	c
suggestion	c
is	c

to	c
the	c
flower	c
market	c
where	c
is	c
very	c
famous	c

it	c
covers	c
2	c
acres	c

there	c
are	c
plenty	c
of	c

of	c
them	c
are	c
natural	c
whereas	c
the	c
others	c
are	c
not	c

Owing	c
to	c

during	c
the	c

Whatever	c
we	c
do	c
at	c

we	c
need	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
imaged	c
how	c
this	c

if	c
there	c
was	c
no	c

Think	c
about	c
when	c

got	c
a	c

Could	c
you	c
do	c
anything	c

In	c
addition	c

Telephone	c
saved	c
my	c
friendship	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
hard	c
to	c
decide	c
which	c
invention	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

Because	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
so	c
important	c
in	c
difference	c
way	c
.	c

As	c
now	c
I	c
'm	c
being	c
away	c
from	c
home	c
,	c
telephone	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

Having	c
telephone	c
I	c
can	c
call	c
my	c
mother	c
,	c
my	c
friends	c
which	c
helping	c
me	c
from	c
home	c
sick	c
,	c
not	c
completely	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
better	c
than	c
other	c
ways	c
.	c

To	c
hear	c
the	c
voice	c
from	c
the	c
person	c
you	c
love	c
is	c
the	c
feelling	c
that	c
hard	c
to	c
describe	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
wonderful	c
and	c
so	c
real	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
their	c
face	c
clearly	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
problem	c
with	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
once	c
when	c
we	c
keep	c
in	c
tuch	c
through	c
e	c
-	c
mail	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
is	c
the	c
language	c
,	c
we	c
used	c
English	c
but	c
we	c
both	c
were	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
by	c
the	c
time	c
which	c
made	c
us	c
misunderstand	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
problem	c
solved	c
by	c
a	c
telephone	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
now	c
still	c
friend	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

I	c
always	c

myself	c
been	c
very	c
looky	c
to	c
be	c
born	c
in	c
the	c
Century	c
because	c
all	c
the	c
amaizing	i
human	c
inventions	c
.	c

As	c
an	c
example	c
let	c
's	c
have	c
a	c
look	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
see	c
of	c
this	c
nation	c
how	c
it	c
has	c
developed	c
.	c

We	c
just	c
need	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
first	c
world	c
wold	i
and	c
all	c
the	c

created	c
thanks	c
to	c
the	c
industrial	c
revolution	c
to	c
these	c
day	c
.	c

However	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
there	c
should	c
emerge	i
more	c
grups	i
to	c
control	i
this	c

because	c
the	c
industrial	c
polution	i
that	c
it	c
has	c
been	c
created	c
and	c
it	c
seems	c
that	c
its	c
very	c
little	c
what	c
has	c
been	c
done	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
in	c

to	i
our	c
embiroment	c

I	c
hope	c
in	c
the	c
future	c

will	c
be	c
more	c

more	c
people	c

I	c
'm	c
ready	c
to	c
help	c
you	c

I	c
think	c
that	c

to	c

which	c
hotel	c
is	c
better	c
for	c
the	c

I	c
have	c
an	c
idea	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
agree	c
with	c
me	c

I	c
was	c
thinking	c
about	c
the	c

's	c
very	c
nice	c

has	c
comfortable	c
bedrooms	c

You	c
can	c
book	c
this	c

's	c
the	c
best	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
near	c
to	c
conference	c
it	c
's	c
only	c
15	c
minutes	c
by	c
walk	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
nice	c
about	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c

give	c
to	c
the	c
student	c
the	c
time	c
to	c
enjoy	c
theirselves	i

to	c

The	c

The	c
clothes	c
now	c
that	c

to	c

not	c
how	c
you	c

going	c
to	c

Those	c

Today	c
our	c
article	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
about	c
an	c
inventions	c
that	c
we	c
need	c
inour	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
all	c
this	c
things	c
we	c
need	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
because	c
it	c
can	c
give	c
us	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
we	c
need	c
the	c
telephone	c
in	c
our	c
house	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
important	c
to	c
make	c
call	c
if	c
you	c
need	c
something	c
of	c
if	c
it	c
something	c
happend	i
to	c
your	c
house	c
and	c
nobody	c
is	c
next	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
one	c
is	c
the	c
lamp	c
,	c
the	c
electricity	c
that	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
past	c
the	c
people	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
electicity	c
and	c
if	c
they	c
wanted	c
for	c
example	c
to	c
read	c
or	c
to	c
cook	c
something	c
they	c
used	c
to	c
do	c
in	c
the	c
fire	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
important	c
to	c
have	c
electricity	c
because	c
without	c
this	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
one	c
is	c
the	c
television	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
have	c
TV	c
because	c
you	c
can	c
liten	c
what	c
it	c
happend	i
in	c
the	c
world	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
watch	c
some	c
places	c
that	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
go	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
enjoy	c
you	c
time	c
to	c
watch	c
a	c
film	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
boat	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
so	c
important	c
but	c
you	c
can	c
use	c
it	c
for	c
fishing	c
and	c
to	c
see	c
some	c
places	c
.	c

The	c
car	c
now	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
you	c
can	c
go	c
wherever	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
year	c
the	c

3	c
cars	c

one	c
family	c
one	c
by	c
one	c
person	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
the	c
telephone	c
because	c
without	c
this	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c

a	c
big	c
hotel	c
because	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
a	c
swimming	c
-	c
pool	c
and	c
a	c
nice	c
bar	c

The	c
hotel	c
is	c
ten	c
minutes	c
far	c
from	c
the	c
conference	c
and	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
bus	c
available	c
to	c
go	c
directly	c
over	c
there	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
conference	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
dinner	c
in	c
a	c
luxurious	c
restaurant	c
so	c
people	c
must	c
have	c
nice	c
clothes	c
;	c
jean	c
's	c
is	c
not	c
allowed	c
.	c

Next	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
disco	c
for	c
people	c
who	c
like	c
dancing	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
in	c
my	c
area	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
visit	c
the	c
old	c
town	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
shops	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
visit	c
the	c
old	c
castle	c
or	c
the	c
painting	c
museum	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
find	c
television	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
invention	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
good	c
for	c
old	c
people	c
because	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
can	c
not	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
anymore	c
.	c

In	c
one	c
hand	c
it	c
's	c
because	c
they	c
have	c
not	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
pay	c
it	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
it	c
's	c
because	c
they	c
ca	c
n't	c
move	c
very	c
well	c
for	c
example	c
if	c
they	c
are	c
disabled	c
.	c

With	c
television	c
,	c
old	c
people	c
are	c
less	c
alone	c
because	c
most	c
of	c
old	c
woman	c
have	c
not	c
her	c
husband	c
anymore	c
.	c

Television	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
to	c
be	c
informed	c
with	c
the	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
being	c
informed	c
by	c
television	c
than	c
by	c
newspapers	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
more	c
relaxing	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
television	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
invention	c
for	c
children	c
when	c
they	c
have	c
free	c
time	c
and	c
while	c
they	c
are	c
watching	c
television	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
after	c
them	c
if	c
we	c
have	c
something	c
important	c
to	c
do	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Maria	c
Smith	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
shame	c
that	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
see	c
Richard	c
because	c
of	c
his	c
illness	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
willing	c
to	c
help	c
you	c
as	c
much	c
as	c
I	c
can	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
which	c
you	c
asked	c
for	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
about	c
your	c
accomodation	i
,	c
our	c
college	c
which	c
I	c
belong	c
to	c
offers	c
visitor	c
free	c
accomodations	i
with	c
full	c
of	c
facilities	c
.	c

(	c
for	c
example	c
bath	i
,	c
car	c
park	c
,	c
free	c
internet	i
access	c
,	c
etc	c
.	c
)	c

They	c
also	c
are	c
located	c
in	c
our	c
campus	i
so	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
by	c
walk	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
we	c
'll	c
have	c
a	c
party	c
after	c
the	c
conference	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
taken	c
place	c
at	c
our	c
student	c
council	c
hall	c
with	c
some	c
meals	c
.	c

This	c
party	c
is	c
unlikely	i
to	c
be	c
that	c
formal	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
recommend	c
you	c
not	c
to	c
wear	c
jeans	c
and	c
trainners	c
.	c

At	c
last	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
free	c
time	c
for	c
couple	c
of	c
ours	c
,	c
you	c
'd	c
better	c
visit	c
Kamakura	c
City	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
30	c
minutes	c
from	c
our	c
campus	i
by	c
train	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
very	c
traditional	c
Japanese	c
city	c
where	c
so	c
many	c
temple	c
and	c
heritages	c
are	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
'll	c
enjoy	c
it	c
and	c
maybe	c
get	c
familier	i
with	c
our	c
culture	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
other	c
questions	c
,	c
please	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
letter	c
again	c
.	c

Oh	c
Baby	c
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
live	c
without	c
you	c
!	c

These	c
days	c
,	c
we	c
've	c
been	c
sorrounded	i
with	c
so	c
any	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
products	c
which	c
our	c
ancestors	c
invented	c
.	c

In	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
we	c
seldom	c
notice	c
how	c
much	c
convinient	i
life	c
we	c
've	c
got	c
,	c
what	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
inconvinient	c
our	c
grandparents	c
had	c
got	c
.	c

How	c
nasty	c
we	c
are	c
!	c

Let	c
us	c
try	c
to	c
appreciate	c
thier	i
importance	c
again	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
the	c
invention	c
which	c
is	c
most	c
important	c
to	c
me	c
is	c
a	c
personal	c
computer	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
a	c
full	c
time	c
student	c
in	c
the	c
university	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
and	c
their	c
classes	c
all	c
requires	c
us	c
to	c
have	c
personal	c
computer	c
and	c
use	c
them	c
at	c
any	c
times	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
take	c
the	c
class	c
on	c
computer	c
programming	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
definetly	i
need	c
one	c
and	c
it	c
holds	i
true	i
for	c
the	c
class	c
on	i
politics	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
study	c
statistic	i
on	c
your	c

for	c
doing	c
social	c
research	c

some	c

My	c
professor	c
said	c
'	c
go	c

get	c
familier	i
with	c
your	c
computer	c
,	c
otherwise	c
you	c
'll	c
fail	c
'	c
.	c

I	c
find	c
it	c
amazingly	c
easy	c
to	c
forget	c
the	c
importance	c
of	c
inventions	c
which	c
we	c
useually	c
use	c
without	c
any	c
questione	c

That	c
's	c
the	c
nature	c
of	c

But	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
not	c

the	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
received	c
yesterday	c
.	c

Below	c
is	c
a	c
piece	c
of	c
information	c
you	c
will	c
need	c
for	c
the	c
next	c
international	c
student	c
conference	c
at	c
Bournemouth	c
College	c
and	c
some	c
recommendations	c
,	c
which	c
might	c
be	c
useful	c
for	c
the	c
students	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
hotel	c
booked	c
for	c
the	c
group	c
is	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
impressive	c
in	c
terms	c
of	c
comfort	c
and	c
facilities	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
central	c
hotel	c
located	c
not	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
the	c
conference	c
hall	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
either	c
by	c
bus	c
(	c
no	c
150	c
)	c
or	c
on	c
foot	c
.	c

Next	c
you	c
are	c
welcome	c
to	c
attend	c
the	c
party	c
organized	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
begin	c
at	c
elevenish	c
p.m.	c
and	c
may	c
last	c
the	c
whole	c
night	c
.	c

People	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
disguised	c
there	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
wear	c
extravagant	c
multi	c
-	i
coloured	i
clothes	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
jump	c
at	c
opportunity	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
historical	c
Pergam	c
's	c
Museum	c
before	c
leaving	c

Some	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
amazing	c
masterpieces	c
are	c
exposed	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
in	c
advance	c
a	c
wonderful	c
trip	c

look	c

Subject	c

Bournemouth	c
National	c
Museum	c

As	c
requested	c
I	c
visited	c
the	c
Bournemouth	c
National	c
Museum	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
,	c
to	c
my	c
mind	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
buildings	c
of	c
the	c
area	c
.	c

Below	c
is	c
a	c
summary	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
relevant	c
points	c
and	c
some	c
recommendations	c
you	c
may	c
need	c
.	c

1	c
.	c
Architecture	c

The	c
architecture	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
in	c
itself	c
is	c
really	c
breathtaking	c
in	c
terms	c
of	c
luxury	c
and	c
ornamentation	c
choice	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
the	c
architectural	i
style	c
may	c
seem	c
a	c
bit	c
'	c
heavy	c
,	c
this	c
building	c
is	c
really	c
a	c
masterpiece	c
with	c
no	c
similar	c
comparison	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

2	c
.	c
Exposition	c

Although	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
tiring	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
whole	c
museum	c
in	c
one	c
day	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
such	c
a	c
rewarding	c
and	c
enriching	c
time	c
that	c
people	c
get	c
never	c
tired	c
of	c
looking	c
at	c
the	c
paintings	c
and	c
sculptures	c
of	c
each	c
section	i
of	c
the	c
museum	c
.	c

3	c
.	c
Restaurant	c

The	c
adjoining	c
restaurant	c
is	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

The	c
waiters	c
are	c
friendly	c
and	c
always	c
ready	c
to	c
give	c
advice	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
it	c
is	c
just	c
what	c
visitors	c
need	c
after	c
their	c
trip	c
through	i
the	c
museum	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
museum	c
is	c
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
the	c
other	c
museums	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
can	c
enjoy	c
not	c
only	c
wonderful	c
masterpieces	c
but	c
also	c
a	c
very	c
uncommon	c
architecture	c
and	c
a	c
quiet	c
restaurant	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
rest	c
if	c
you	c
need	c

easiest	c
way	c
to	c
travel	c
from	i

conference	c
party	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
small	c
disco	c
,	c
with	c
a	c
variety	c
of	c
drinks	c
and	c
food	c
provided	c

Therefore	c

you	c
could	c

quite	c
casual	c

Lastly	c

on	c
the	c
last	c

I	c
would	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Edinburgh	c
Castle	c
and	c
the	c
National	c
Scottish	c
Museum	c
,	c
as	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
have	c
the	c
student	c
discount	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
this	c
letter	c
should	c
help	c
you	c
with	c
enough	c
information	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Could	c
modern	c
people	c
live	c
without	c
a	c
light	c
bulb	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
so	c
.	c

Only	c
people	c
who	c
could	c
live	c
without	c
it	c
,	c
must	c
be	c
extremely	c
weird	c
or	c
somebody	c
in	c
a	c
very	c
difficult	c
situation	c
!	c

We	c
are	c
nearly	c
always	c
surrounded	c
by	c
the	c
'	c
man	c
-	c
made	c
'	c
light	c
.	c

With	c
it	c
,	c
we	c
read	c
,	c
study	c
,	c
walk	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
past	c
people	c
relied	c
on	c
the	c
sunlight	c
,	c
moonlight	i
and	c
the	c
light	c
from	c
fire	i
.	c

These	c
were	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
very	c
unreliable	i
when	c
the	c
weather	c
was	c
bad	c
and	c
when	c
the	c
fuel	c
ran	c
out	c
.	c

They	c
had	c
to	c
read	c
,	c
study	c
and	c
walk	c
in	c
the	c
dark	c
.	c

Today	c
,	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
thing	c
hardly	c
happens	i
!	c

Well	c
,	c
unless	c
there	c
was	c
n't	c
anything	c
wrong	c
with	c
the	c
power	c
supply	i
.	c

I	c
remember	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
about	c
5	c
,	c
I	c
visited	c
a	c
museum	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
toilet	i
,	c
all	c
the	c
light	c
was	c
turned	c
off	c
!	c

I	c
screamed	c
and	c
cried	c
since	c
I	c
'd	c
never	c
experienced	c
being	i
in	c
a	c
complete	c
darkness	c
before	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
light	c
was	c
turned	c
on	c
again	c
,	c
I	c
realised	c
how	c
important	c
even	c
a	c
single	c
light	c
bulb	c
would	c
be	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
sure	c
I	c
can	c
never	c
,	c
ever	c
live	c
without	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Maria	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sorry	c

As	c

conference	c
must	c
go	c
on	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
asked	c
for	c
in	c
order	c
to	c

this	c
conference	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
hotel	c

the	c
group	c
has	c
been	c
arranged	c

a	c

which	c
is	c
very	c

the	c
place	c

have	c
the	c
conference	c

The	c
hotel	c

The	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c

It'is	c
just	c
only	c
5	c
minutes	c
walk	c
from	c
there	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
that	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c

the	c

About	c
the	c
party	c

a	c

at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
conference	c
at	c
the	c
hotel	c

will	c
stay	c
.	c

The	c
party	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
friendly	c
atmosphere	c
so	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
about	c

to	c
wear	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
only	c
our	c

,	c
so	c
dress	c
whatever	c
you	c
want	c
and	c
enjoy	c
ourselves	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
what	c
you	c
could	c
possibly	c
do	c
while	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
waiting	c
for	c
three	c
hours	c
,	c
for	c
some	c
people	c
who	c

go	c
shopping	c
.	c

The	c
shopping	c
centre	c
is	c
just	c
right	c
opposite	c
of	c
the	c
hotel	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
some	c
people	c
may	c
want	c
to	c
just	c
wait	c
at	c
the	c
hotel	c
,	c
having	c
a	c
cup	c
of	c
coffee	c
.	c

The	c
cafe	c
in	c
the	c
hotel	c
is	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
information	c
will	c
be	c
useful	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
questions	c
I	c
am	c
more	c
than	c
happy	c

I	c
look	c

to	c
seeing	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
live	c
without	c
this	c
?	c

Imagine	c
how	c
your	c
life	c
would	c
be	c
if	c
you	c
woke	c
up	c
one	c
morning	c
and	c
found	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
electricity	c
had	c
gone	c
.	c

How	c
would	c
you	c
manage	c
to	c
get	c
yourself	c
ready	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

How	c
would	c
you	c
know	c
what	c
happens	c
in	c
the	c
whole	c
wide	c
world	c
or	c
even	c
how	c
you	c
would	c
get	c
yourself	c
breakfast	c
without	c
toaster	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

How	c
would	c
you	c
cope	c
with	c
all	c
those	c
?	c

Thank	c
god	c
for	c
those	c
who	c
had	c
created	c
the	c
electricity	c
and	c
had	c
appliedapplied	c
it	c
into	c
every	c
appliances	c
.	c

The	c
electricity	c
is	c
a	c
clever	c
invention	c
.	c

Everything	c
bases	c
on	c
the	c
use	c
of	c
electricity	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
from	c
a	c
little	c
bulb	c
light	c
to	c
the	c
most	c
complicated	c
computer	c
system	c
which	c
stored	c
priceless	c
information	c
!	c

Life	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
easy	c
if	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
electricity	c
.	c

The	c
electricity	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
in	c
keeping	c
our	c
lives	c
go	c
.	c

No	c
matter	c
where	c
you	c
are	c
,	c
what	c
you	c
do	c
,	c
apparantly	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
the	c
electricity	c
.	c

Let	c
's	c
think	c
this	c
way	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
the	c
electricity	c
,	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
no	c
other	c
inventions	c
at	c
all	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
,	c
personally	c
,	c
could	c
n't	c
live	c
without	c
the	c
electricity	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
already	c
affected	c
and	c
play	c
a	c
great	c
role	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
watch	c
the	c
television	c
and	c
use	c
the	c
computer	c
everyday	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
other	c
facilities	c
in	c
my	c

,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
all	c
need	c
the	c
electricity	c
.	c
That'is	i
why	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
to	c
my	c
life	c

just	c
three	c
busstops	c
away	c
from	c
our	c
college	c

So	c
you	c

can	c
take	c
the	c

The	c

For	c

short	c
letter	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
invention	c
of	c
the	c
car	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
point	c
in	c
history	c
.	c

From	c
there	c
on	c
people	c
got	c
mobile	c
and	c
had	c
the	c
possibility	c
to	c
travel	c
wherever	c
they	c
wanted	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
within	c
the	c
physical	c
barriers	c
.	c

People	c
now	c
had	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
move	c
to	c
far	c
away	c
places	c
to	c
spend	c
their	c
leassure	c
time	c
,	c
to	c
relax	c
,	c
or	c
just	c
to	c
see	c
something	c
different	c
than	c
their	c
home	c
-	c
countryside	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
life	c
the	c
car	c
has	c
an	c
enormous	c
influence	c
.	c
I	c
come	c
from	c
a	c
rural	c
area	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
city	c
is	c
15	c
km	c
away	c
and	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
acceptable	c
bus	c
-	c
or	c
rail	c
connection	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
been	c
quiet	c
hard	c
to	c
me	c
not	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
opportunities	c
for	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
like	c
my	c
friends	c
that	c
lived	c
in	c
or	c
near	c
the	c
city	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
had	c
no	c
possibility	c
to	c
meet	c
them	c
after	c
school	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
no	c
vehicle	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
needed	c
my	c
Mom	c
or	c
my	c
Dad	c
to	c
take	c
me	c
where	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

Today	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
own	c
car	c
and	c
I	c
use	c
it	c
daily	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
work	c
and	c
to	c
meet	c
my	c
friends	c
at	c
any	c
place	c
and	c
any	c
time	c
.	c

So	c
with	c
my	c
car	c
I	c
achieved	c
a	c
great	c
freedom	c
.	c

She	c

somebody	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
that	c
day	c
would	c
be	c

like	c
every	c
morning	c
,	c
and	c
she	c

But	c
that	c
day	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
different	c
:	c
she	c
had	c
her	c
maths	c
exam	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
never	c
passed	c
an	c
maths	c
exam	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
really	c
nervous	c
.	c

Half	c
an	c

found	c
a	c
lottery	c
ticket	c
.	c

Nobody	c
was	c
around	c
her	c
,	c
so	c
she	c
took	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

Drank	c
her	c
cup	c
of	c
tea	c
and	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
classroom	c
where	c
the	c
exam	c
took	c
place	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
the	c
exam	c
really	c
well	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
,	c
and	c
after	c
the	c
exam	c
she	c
went	c
home	c
.	c

She	c
spend	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
listening	c
to	c
music	c
while	c
she	c
was	c
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
lottery	c

and	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
TV	c
show	c
at	c
8	c
o'clock	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
she	c
turned	c
on	c
the	c
TV	c
and	c
while	c

Secondly	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
no	c
problems	c
finding	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

Obviously	c
,	c
using	c
a	c
taxi	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
it	c
is	c
quite	c
expensive	c
for	c
student	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
already	c
prepared	c
a	c
mini	c

bus	c
for	c

concert	c
which	c
we	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c

the	c
best	c
and	c
the	c
easiest	c
way	c
of	c
knowing	c
Cambridge	c

Inventions	c
have	c
affected	c
all	c
our	c
lives	c
!	c

What	c
is	c
it	c
what	c
we	c
use	c
every	c
day	c
many	c
hours	c
?	c

Sometime	i
's	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
until	c
late	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

Yes	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
TV	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
well	c
know	c
in	c
almost	c
all	c
family	c
,	c
often	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
cannels	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
TV	c
can	c
tell	c
us	c
news	c
in	c
a	c
short	c
time	c
,	c
what	c
happened	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
in	c
favour	c
of	c
the	c
invention	c
for	c
the	c
TV	c
is	c
,	c
that	c
they	c
telling	c
about	c
interesting	c
reports	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
about	c
animals	c
or	c
different	c
culture	c
from	c
other	c
countrys	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
they	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
programme	c
,	c
usually	c
something	c
for	c
everybody	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
also	c
relaxing	c
to	c
sit	c
on	c
the	c
sofa	c
after	c
a	c
busy	c
day	c
at	c
work	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
TV	c
is	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
very	c
useful	c
for	c
getting	c
important	c
information	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
watching	c
the	c
weather	c
and	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
present	c
in	c
wonderful	c
colour	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
TV	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
and	c
useful	c
invention	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
they	c
send	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
violence	c
which	c
is	c
not	c
good	c
for	c
the	c
children	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
not	c
imagine	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
televison	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
something	c
what	c
we	c
need	c
for	c
our	c
education	c
,	c
for	c
getting	c

The	c
telephone	c
was	c
invented	c
by	c
Alexander	c
Graham	c
Bell	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
19th	c
century	c

It	c
was	c
an	c
invention	c
nobody	c
thought	c
how	c
important	c
and	c
how	c
widespread	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
in	c
future	c

Nowadays	c
almost	c
every	c
household	i
in	c
the	c
western	i
world	c
owns	i
a	c
telephone	c

all	c
over	c
the	c

no	c
strange	c
thing	c

People	c
need	c
the	c
telephone	c
not	c
only	c
for	c
chatting	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
for	c
exchanging	c

direct	i
way	i

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
no	c
telephone	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
always	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
phone	c
box	c
in	c
the	c
centre	c
of	c
our	c

Now	c
I	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Maria	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
already	c
talked	c
to	c
Richard	c
Brown	c
and	c
he	c
informed	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

Next	c
week	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
start	c
organising	c
some	c
events	c
for	c
this	c
conference	c
.	c

The	c
event	c
will	c
organize	c
at	c
the	c
Palace	c

The	c
same	c
hotel	c
that	c
will	c
you	c
stay	c

Palace	c
Hotel	c
is	c
opposite	c
the	c
park	c
'	c
Clifton	c
'	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
near	c
the	c
college	c
.	c

We	c
chose	c
that	c
hotel	c
because	c
is	c
it	c
near	c
the	c
college	c
and	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
use	c
a	c
transport	c
.	c

Because	c
you	c
know	c
where	c
is	c
the	c
college	c
and	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
some	c
things	c
at	c
the	c
college	c
to	c
hotel	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
is	c
better	c
to	c
come	c
all	c
the	c
group	c
in	c
college	c
and	c
then	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
all	c
together	c
to	c
the	c
'	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
'	c
.	c

The	c
conference	c
start	c
at	c
9:00	i
o'clock	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
at	c
the	c
college	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
before	c

Concerning	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c

Tell	c

About	c
the	c

that	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
wear	c
,	c
must	c
be	c
uniform	c
,	c
because	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
conference	c
to	c
London	c
and	c
every	c
year	i
are	c
coming	c
lectures	c
from	c
other	c
colleges	i

Finally	c
on	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
we	c
have	c
organised	c
a	c
seeing	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
about	c
that	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
me	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
a	c
hotel	c
whose	c
name	c
is	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
has	c
been	c
booked	c
for	c
your	c
group	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
from	c
there	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
is	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
taxi	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
there	c
are	c
no	c
buses	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
party	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

The	c
party	c
will	c
be	c
formal	c
,	c
therefore	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
formal	c
clothes	c
like	c
a	c
suit	c
or	c
a	c
dress	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
suitable	c
to	c
wear	c
a	c
jean	c
or	c
something	c
.	c

On	c
your	c
last	c
day	c
you	c
have	c
an	c
afternoon	c
free	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
area	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
fantastic	c
park	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
famous	c
park	c
in	c
the	c
country	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
find	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
or	c
to	c
see	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
visit	c
the	c
zoo	c
or	c
walk	c
around	c
the	c
amazing	c
lake	c
in	c
the	c
park	c

I	c

which	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c

If	c

Your	i
Sincerely	c

Power	c
Of	c
Computurs	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
can	c
a	c
computer	c
affect	c
your	c
life	c
?	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
effects	c
more	c
than	c
you	c
think	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
lyrics	c
of	c
the	c
songs	c
that	c
I	c
liked	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
nearly	c
impossible	c
to	c
have	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
lack	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
first	c
bought	c
a	c
computer	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
university	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
computer	c
programmer	c
.	c

That	c
time	c
I	c
met	c
the	c
magic	c
world	c
of	c
computers	c
.	c

Linking	c
to	c
the	c
internet	i
was	c
so	c
popular	c
.	c

Internet	i
was	c
something	c
amazing	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
have	c
every	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
whenever	c
you	c
want	c
?	c

Can	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
contact	c
with	c
anyone	c
who	c
is	c
from	c
any	c
country	c
whenever	c
you	c
want	c
?	c

I	c
meet	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
on	i
internet	i
and	c
it	c
really	c
interest	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
learn	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
their	c
culture	c
by	c
speaking	c
them	c
on	c
internet	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
imagine	c
this	c
before	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
this	c
,	c
today	c
companies	c
can	c
do	c
nothing	c
without	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

Everything	c
in	c
this	c
world	c
works	c
with	c
computers	c
from	c
now	c
on	c
.	c

Computers	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
style	c
,	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

And	c
they	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
M.	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
requested	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
hotel	c
is	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
,	c
82	i
Regent	c
Street	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
easy	c
to	c
reach	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
you	c
can	c
take	c
the	c
bus	c
number	c
3	c
;	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
the	c
bus	c
stop	c
is	c
just	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
hotel	c
,	c
then	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
off	c
immediately	c
after	c
the	c
church	c
that	c
you	c
pass	c
,	c
on	c
your	c
right	c
hand	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
party	c
in	c
the	c
hotel	c
at	c
8.00	c
o'clock	c
and	c
a	c
buffet	c
will	c
be	c
served	c
at	c
8.30	c
p.m.	c
It	c
would	c
be	c
also	c
possible	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
vegetarian	c
food	c
and	c
drink	c
cocktails	c
free	c
of	c
charge	c
.	c
I	c
would	c
recommend	c
your	c
students	c
to	c
bring	c
their	c
Identity	c
Card	c
to	c
prove	c
their	c
age	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	c
wear	c
very	c
smart	c
dress	c
and	c
for	c
men	c
it	c
is	c
oblidged	c
the	c
tie	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
were	c
you	c
I	c
would	c
go	c
shopping	c
to	c
the	c
City	c
Centre	c
to	c
spend	c
your	c
last	c
hours	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
re	c
interested	c
in	c
Archeology	c
you	c
should	c
vitis	i
the	c
History	c
Museum	c
in	c
Garden	c
Square	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
my	c
letter	c
of	c
interest	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c
,	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
thought	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
your	c
car	c
?	c

How	c
can	c
you	c
manage	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
without	c
it	c
?	c

I	c
the	c
last	c
fourty	i
years	c
people	c
seem	c
to	c
be	c
completely	c
addicted	c
by	i
using	c
their	c
own	c
car	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
the	c
citizens	c
has	c
got	c
a	c
car	c
and	c
unfortunately	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
cities	c
are	c
getting	c
more	c
polluted	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
facility	i
has	c
made	c
our	c
life	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
easy	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
everywhere	c
sitting	c
either	c
with	c
friends	c
or	c
with	c
our	c
family	c
and	c
carring	i
lugguage	c
and	c
shopping	c
bags	c
.	c

Cars	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
cover	c
not	c
only	c
short	c
distance	c
but	c
also	c
can	c
be	c
used	c
for	c
long	c
journey	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
it	c
would	c
had	c
been	c
extremely	c
exhausting	c
travelling	c
riding	c
a	c
hourse	c
but	c
nowadays	c
we	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
big	c
and	c
spacious	c
cars	c
and	c
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
optionals	c
to	c
choose	c
with	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
has	c
made	c
people	c
be	c
lazy	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
stressed	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
traffic	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
advantages	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
save	c
time	c
and	c
money	c
as	c
cars	c
have	c
long	c
last	c
and	c
allowe	c
us	c
travelling	c
quickly	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
image	c
my	c
life	c
without	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
nobody	c

I	c
phoned	c

I	c
got	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
accomodation	i
of	c
the	c
students	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
book	c
at	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
an	c
outstanding	c

situated	c

The	c

a	c
good	c
position	c
,	c
10	c
minutes	c
walk	c
from	c

conference	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
reach	c
it	c
is	c
on	c
foot	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
the	c

will	c
enjoy	c

The	c
conference	c
starts	c
at	c
5	c

in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
and	c
finishes	c
at	c
7	c
pm	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
should	c
wear	c
smart	c
dress	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
lots	c

In	c

for	c
the	c

I	c
thought	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
for	c
the	c

to	c

CONCLUSION	c

Although	c
the	c

is	c
quite	c
expensive	c
for	c
a	c
group	c
of	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
asked	c
in	c
your	c

which	c
I	c
received	c
this	c

Your	c

been	c
booked	c
in	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c

is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
comfortable	c
hotels	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
glad	c

have	c
this	c
opportunity	c
to	c
use	c
its	c
various	c
facilities	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
based	c
in	c
the	c
city	c
centre	c
and	c
is	c
about	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
by	c
underground	c
from	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
oppinion	i
the	c
easiest	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
from	c
the	c
conference	c
would	c
be	c
by	c
taking	c
the	c
Picadelly	c
line	c
.	c

However	c
you	c
would	c
take	c
bus	c
number	c
150	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
look	c
at	c
the	c
city	c
centre	c
and	c

have	c
some	c
free	c

the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c

conference	c
party	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	c
wear	c
some	c
dress	c
for	c
a	c
woman	c
and	c
an	c
elegant	c

for	c
a	c
man	c
,	c
though	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
no	c
formal	c

.	c

The	c
party	c
will	c
finish	c
quite	c
late	c
so	c
we	c
've	c
decided	c
to	c
provide	c

would	c
take	c

to	c
the	c

hour	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
nobody	c
is	c
able	c
to	c
visit	c
all	c
of	c
interesting	c
places	c
of	c
London	c
.	c

However	c
you	c
would	c
have	c
a	c
long	c
walk	c
along	c
the	c
river	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
essential	c
photos	c

I	c
look	c

to	c
welcoming	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Are	c
you	c
always	c
happy	c
when	c
your	c
telephon	i
ring	c
?	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
the	c
telephone	c
was	c
invented	c
in	c
19th	c
century	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
been	c
affecting	c
our	c
lifes	i
very	c
quickly	c
,	c
although	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
different	c
ways	c
of	c
communication	c
as	c
TV	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
.	c

Since	c
the	c
internet	i
was	c
introduced	c
,	c
many	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
imagined	c
the	c
lifes	i
without	c
this	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
able	c
even	c
to	c
have	c
our	c
own	c
telephone	c
kept	c
in	c
our	c
pocket	c
for	c
a	c
some	c
time	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
are	c
you	c
always	c
happy	c
when	c
your	c
personal	c
phone	c
rings	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
wonder	c
whether	c
you	c
have	c
experienced	c
some	c
situations	c
when	c
you	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
your	c
mobile	c
switched	c
on	c
.	c

This	c
invention	c
has	c
affected	c
my	c
life	c
completely	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
traveling	i
around	c
the	c
world	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
imagined	i
beeing	i
in	c
tough	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
or	c
friends	c
without	c
internet	i
or	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
having	c
the	c
opportunity	c
of	c
keeping	c
contact	c
with	c
friends	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
we	c
are	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
home	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
knowledge	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
it	c
without	c
interrupting	c
others	c

The	c
Telephone	c
:	c
A	c
great	c
invention	c
.	c

Imagine	c
your	c
life	c
without	c
a	c
telephone	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
I	c
know	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
just	c
hard	c
to	c
imagine	c
our	c
lives	c
without	c
this	c
invention	c
.	c

Think	c
about	c
the	c
people	c
living	c
in	c
the	c
time	c
it	c
was	c
invented	c
.	c

Must	c
had	c
been	c
such	c
a	c
exciting	c
thing	c
being	c
able	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
someone	c
living	c
thousands	c
of	c
miles	c
for	c
........	i
and	c
now	c
for	c
us	c
is	c
just	c
as	c
simple	c
as	c
dial	c
a	c
number	c
and	c
talk	c
to	c
whoever	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
is	c
nice	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
phone	c
conversation	c
with	c
friends	c
or	c
family	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
telephone	c
is	c
also	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
business	c
and	c
emergencies	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
work	c
for	c
a	c
bank	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
have	c
weekly	c
meetings	c
with	c
our	c
Director	c
living	c
800	c
kilometers	i
far	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
does	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
come	c
here	c
,	c
we	c
just	c
have	c
a	c
phone	c
conference	c
where	c
everybody	c
can	c
talks	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
it	c
!	c

What	c
about	c
emergencies	c
?	c

A	c
phone	c
call	c
in	c
time	c
for	c
an	c
ambulance	c
can	c
save	c
the	c
life	c
of	c
many	c
people	c
having	c
a	c
heart	c
attack	c
.	c

We	c
sometimes	c
do	c
n't	c
realize	c
the	c
importance	c
of	c
some	c
inventions	c
we	c
use	c
in	c
our	c
everyday	c
life	c
.	c

But	c
think	c
....	c
,	c
what	c
would	c
we	c
do	c
without	c

AFFECTED	c
ALL	c
OUR	c
LIVES	c

The	c
invention	c
without	c
no	c
doubt	c
,	c
that	c
has	c
affected	c
my	c
own	c
life	c
by	c
far	c
is	c
the	c
car	c
.	c

Cars	c
have	c
definitely	c
changed	c
all	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
refering	i
only	i
in	i
a	c
positive	c
way	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
a	c
negative	c
way	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Picture	c
this	c
:	c
a	c
big	c
city	c
such	c
as	c
London	c
or	c
New	c
York	c
with	c
no	c
cars	c
on	c
their	c
streets	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
imagine	c
it	c
?	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
.	c

Cars	c
are	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
daily	c
lives	c
.	c

Traffic	c
jams	c
make	c
people	c
nervous	c
,	c
sometimes	c
really	c
upset	c
and	c
violent	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
anyway	c
,	c
people	c
use	c
cars	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
use	c
them	c
we	c
suffer	c
from	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
case	c
I	c
use	c
public	c
transport	c
during	c
the	c
week	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
hardly	c
imagine	c
my	c
weekends	c
without	c
my	c
beloved	c
car	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
need	c
it	c
to	c
escape	c
from	c
the	c
pollution	c
,	c
mainly	c
caused	c
by	c
cars	c
and	c
any	c
other	c
four	c
-	c
wheel	i
motored	c
vehicle	c
.	c

Is	c
n't	c
that	c
contradictorious	c
?	c

To	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
countryside	c
and	c
being	c
able	c
to	c
breath	c
fresh	c
,	c
non	c
-	c
polluted	c
air	c
,	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
car	c
,	c
which	c
,	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
does	c
not	c
help	c
to	c
maintain	c
a	c
clean	c
air	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
am	c
thinking	c
in	c
selling	c
my	c
car	c
,	c
which	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
over	c
the	c
last	c
10	c
years	c
,	c
which	c
has	c
given	c
me	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
freedom	c
,	c
which	c
has	c
gone	c
with	c
me	c
to	c
all	c
sort	c
of	c
fantastic	c
places	c
,	c
and	c
change	c
my	c

this	c
party	c
is	c
a	c
formal	c
one	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
should	c
be	c
casual	c
dressed	c

In	c
this	c
area	c
you	c

visit	c
the	c
central	c

It	c

Another	c
place	c
that	c
would	c

Introduction	c
:	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
asked	c
for	c
information	c
on	c
an	c
interesting	c
building	c
to	c
visit	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
Hampton	c
Court	c
last	c
year	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
place	c
to	c
visit	c
.	c

Location	c
:	c

Hampton	i
Court	c
palace	c
is	c
localizated	c
in	c
Hampton	i
Court	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
town	c
is	c
wonderful	c
and	c
it	c
has	c
a	c
magical	c
beauty	c
.	c

transport	c
:	c

to	c
get	c
to	c
Hampton	c
Court	c
palace	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
train	c
from	c
Waterloo	c
train	c
station	c
.	c

From	c
there	c
depart	c
the	c
trains	c
to	c
Hampton	i
Court	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
by	c
train	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
,	c
because	c
Hampton	c
Court	c
train	c
station	c
is	c
very	c
close	c
to	c
Hampton	c
Court	c
palace	c
.	c

Price	c
:	c

there	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
price	c
for	c
children	c
,	c
students	c
,	c
adults	c
and	c
families	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
between	c
three	c
and	c
six	c
pounds	c
each	c
.	c

Conclusion	c
:	c

Hampton	c
Court	c
Palace	c
is	c
a	c
building	c
with	c
lots	c
of	c
history	c
and	c
interesting	c
things	c
to	c
see	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
an	c
excellent	c
chance	c
for	c
this	c
group	c
of	c
American	c
students	c
to	c

it	c
was	c
very	c

many	c
things	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
do	c
under	c
the	c
oil	c

because	c
the	c
light	c
range	c
was	c
very	c

was	c

The	c
kingdom	c
Chosun	c
has	c
a	c
history	c
for	c
500	c
years	c
and	c

until	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
20th	c
century	c
.	c

Kyong	c
Bok	c
Palace	c
was	c
the	c
main	c
residence	c
of	c
the	c
royal	i
family	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
imagine	c
its	c
size	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
kings	c
of	c

loved	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
nature	c
,	c
the	c
palace	c
had	c
a	c
huge	c
garden	c
,	c
however	c
it	c
was	c
destroyed	c
by	c
the	c

a	c

who	c
was	c
killed	c
by	c
the	c
Japanese	i
army	i
.	c

.	c

Activity	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
that	c
this	c

also	c
popular	c
for	c

youngsters	c

the	c
traditional	c

there	c
is	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c

It	c
is	c
out	c
of	c
question	i
not	c
to	c

The	c
easiest	c
way	c
to	c

there	c
is	c

extra	c

Less	c
of	c
the	c
party	c
is	c
likely	c
to	c
be	c
as	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Can	c
you	c
see	c
how	c
many	c
inventions	c
you	c
are	c
surrounded	c
with	c
in	c
your	c
life	c
?	c

Such	c
a	c
simple	c
and	c
usuall	i
things	c
like	c
a	c
telefone	c
,	c
a	c
car	c
,	c
a	c
computer	c
so	c
only	c
seem	c
to	c
be	c
normal	c
and	c
usuall	i
for	c
us	c
(	c
or	c
we	c
have	c
got	c
used	c
)	c
as	c
we	c
use	c
them	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

Hundred	c
years	c
before	c
people	c
could	c
n't	c
even	c
use	c
an	c
electric	c
lump	i
not	c
saying	c
about	c
a	c
car	c
or	c
computer	c
.	c

They	c
have	c
intentions	c
improved	c
our	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
since	c
they	c
had	c
appeared	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
every	c
one	c
beleives	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
so	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
say	c
that	c
many	c
of	c
important	c
inventions	c
in	c
our	c
live	c
are	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
and	c
useful	c
as	c
we	c
have	c
got	c
used	c
to	c
see	c
them	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
they	c
say	c
about	c
enviroment	i
pollution	c
which	c
cars	c
and	c
other	c
vechicles	i
make	c
,	c
overspending	c
the	c
electricity	c
using	c
electric	c
equipment	c
and	c
some	c
others	c
.	c

But	c
to	c
my	c
opinion	c
if	c
peoples	i
inventions	c
take	i
a	c
place	c
in	c
our	c
lifes	i
they	c
are	c
right	c
then	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
telefone	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
in	c
many	c
people	c
's	c
lifes	i
as	c
it	c
makes	c
you	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
get	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
anyone	c
does	c
n't	c
matter	c
wherever	c
you	c
are	c
(	c
I	c
am	c
talking	c
about	c
mobile	c
phones	c
which	c
now	c
have	c
a	c
majority	c
of	c
our	c
choice	c
)	c
.	c

Computers	c
make	c
everything	c
much	c
faster	c
so	c
everything	c
is	c
now	c
based	c
on	c
computer	c
systems	c
.	c

An	c
electric	c
lamp	c
was	c
an	c
important	c
invention	c
hundred	c
years	c
before	c
(	c
but	c
for	c
that	c
time	c
it	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
revolution	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
survive	c
for	c
us	c
without	c
an	c
eclectric	c
life	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
shipbuilding	i
development	c
people	c
could	c
make	c
all	c
the	c
geographical	c
discoveries	c
,	c
and	c
an	c
automobile	c
transport	c
is	c
undenyable	i
neccecerity	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
case	c
of	c
all	c
said	c
I	c
am	c
more	c
likely	c
to	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
benefits	c
of	c
advantages	c
of	c
peopel	i
's	c
inventions	c
are	c
much	c
higre	c
the	c
all	c
their	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c

I	c

happy	c
to	c

with	c
giving	c
you	c
some	c
further	c

.	c

According	i
to	c
your	c
first	c
question	c
,	c
for	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
conference	c
the	c
students	c
will	c
be	c

Hotel	c
,	c
where	c
the	c

already	c
made	c

It	c
is	c
situated	c
near	c

about	c
five	c

the	c
fact	c
that	c

this	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Maria	c
Smith	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
advice	c
of	c
an	c
international	c
student	c
conference	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
name	c
of	c
hotel	c
which	c
we	c
have	c
been	c
booked	c
into	c
is	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
.	c

And	c
we	c
have	c
two	c
choices	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
,	c
a	c
bus	c
or	c
a	c
train	c
.	c

Both	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
as	c
convinience	i
as	c
getting	c
there	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
before	c
we	c
will	c
leave	c
there	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
party	c
which	c
takes	c
place	c
in	c
our	c
hotel	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
formal	c
party	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
should	c
be	c
well	c
-	c
dressed	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
wear	c
a	c
formal	c
dress	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
some	c
finger	c
foods	i
and	c
drinks	c
.	c

It	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
party	c
for	c
end	i
of	c
conference	c
.	c

End	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
a	c
center	c
of	c
the	c
town	c
because	c
there	c
is	c
many	c
places	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
look	c
and	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
quite	c
a	c
nice	c
and	c
a	c
suitable	c
place	c
to	c
spend	c
for	c
three	c
hours	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
interesting	c
for	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Imagine	c
our	c
life	c
without	c
a	c
telephone	c
.	c

If	c
a	c
telephone	c
haven't	c
been	c
invented	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
lived	c
perfectly	c
like	c
nowadays	c
.	c

Would	c
n't	c
you	c
think	c
we	c
rely	c
on	c
it	c
more	c
than	c
we	c
expect	c
?	c

A	c
telephone	c
is	c
used	c
when	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
contact	c
with	c
someone	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
an	c
emergency	c
situation	c
and	c
an	c
internet	i
.	c

It	c
has	c
various	c
way	c
to	c
use	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
nowadays	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
only	c
used	c
by	c
these	c
purpose	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
it	c
keeps	c
our	c
company	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
you	c
feel	c
alone	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
talk	c
and	c
hear	c
from	c
your	c
friend	c
easily	c
.	c

Then	c
it	c
makes	c
you	c
happy	c
.	c

Long	c
time	c
ago	c
people	c
lived	c
without	c
this	c
perfect	c
invention	c
.	c

But	c
how	c
?	c

They	c
used	c
to	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
someone	c
with	c
a	c
letter	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
taking	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
to	c
catch	c
up	c
with	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
only	c
way	c
.	c

So	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
they	c
have	c
invented	c
a	c
telephon	i
.	c

Now	c
we	c
could	c
feel	c
the	c
world	c
closer	c
and	c
closer	c
beaus	i
of	c
a	c
telephone	c
.	c

Who	c
would	c
n't	c
thank	c
for	c
this	c
great	c
invention	c
?	c

The	c
easiest	c
way	c
from	c

at	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
will	c
write	c
about	c
the	c
invention	c
of	c
the	c
computer	c

With	c
the	c
computer	c
our	c
work	c
is	c
easier	c
and	c
more	c
interesting	c
.	c

Before	c
the	c
time	c
with	c
computers	c

people	c
had	c
to	c
write	c
every	i

When	c
they	c
would	c

they	c
had	c
to	c
write	c
the	c
whole	c

With	c
the	c
computer	c

correct	c

We	c
save	c
the	c

in	c
three	c

we	c
could	c
send	c

If	c
I	c

To	c

Some	c
musicians	c

there	c
will	c
be	c

some	c
formal	c
clothes	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
necessary	c
really	c
pretty	c
clothes	c

For	c
three	c
hours	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
museum	c
of	c
the	c
Red	c
Cross	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
these	c

will	c
help	c

Sincerely	c
yours	c
,	c

The	c
portable	c
phone	c
,	c
a	c
very	c
useful	c
invention	c
!	c

During	c
all	c
mankind	c
history	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
discovers	c
who	c
tried	c
to	c
make	c
human	c
life	c
better	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
century	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
the	c
most	c
biggest	c
discoveries	c
made	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
phone	c
without	c
cable	i
was	c
invented	c
,	c
one	c
was	c
n't	c
sure	c
if	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
success	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
research	c
went	c
on	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
portable	c
phone	c
is	c
getting	c
always	c
smaller	c
and	c
more	c
useful	c
.	c

The	c
portable	c
phone	c
is	c
an	c
important	c
invention	c
,	c
because	c
nearly	c
everybody	c
has	c
one	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
one	c
can	c
always	c
call	c
somebody	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
some	c
portable	c
phones	c
have	c
a	c
connection	c
to	c
the	c
web	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
easy	c
to	c
read	c
newspapers	c
if	c
one	c
hasn't	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
the	c
portable	c
phone	c
has	c
affected	c
my	c
own	c
life	c
,	c
because	c
when	c
somebody	c
is	c
phoning	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
rush	c
to	c
take	c
the	c
phone	c
,	c
being	c
afraid	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

I	c
recommend	c
this	c
extremely	c
important	c
invention	c
to	c
those	c
who	c
still	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
portable	c
phone	c

Time	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
whoever	c
invented	c
the	c
cars	c
and	c
transportation	c
vehicles	i
did	c
the	c
most	c
respectable	c
invention	c
of	c
the	c
word	c
.	c

I	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
they	c
save	c
our	c
times	c
passing	i
so	c
fast	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
deny	c
how	c
quickly	c
we	c
get	c
somewhere	c
by	c
car	c
or	c
by	c
bus	c
.	c

May	i
be	c
10	c
times	c
as	c
quick	i
as	c
getting	c
somewhere	c
on	c
foot	c
.	c

Try	c
to	c
imagine	c
your	c
life	c
without	c
having	c
anyof	c
them	c
.	c

Would	c
n't	c
be	c
unbarable	c
and	c
painful	c
.	c

Ceartainly	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
just	c
like	c
mine	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
rural	c
area	c
far	c
from	c
any	c
village	c
,	c
town	c
,	c
or	c
city	c
center	i
.	c

The	c
nearest	c
civilization	c
takes	c
me	c
1	c
hour	c
on	c
foot	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
car	c
,	c
no	c
local	c
bus	c
service	c
to	c
use	c
.	c

Even	c
comeing	c
to	c
Basingstoke	c
seems	c
like	c
a	c
international	c
journey	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

And	c
ofcause	c
this	c
stops	c
me	c
everytime	i
to	c
live	c
sociable	c
life	c
.	c

But	c
also	c
I	c
'm	c
aware	c
of	c
that	c
the	c
time	c
flies	c
for	c
me	c
.	c
I	c
must	c
do	c
whatever	c
I	c
want	c
befor	i
it	c
is	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
confess	c
the	c
invention	c
of	c
the	c
car	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
usefull	i

We	c

Some	c

of	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

it	c
is	c
with	c
great	c
regret	c
that	c
I	c
hear	c
of	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
's	c
illness	c
,	c
and	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
soon	c
in	c
an	c
excellent	c
health	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
both	c
pleased	c
and	c
honoured	i
to	c
expect	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
group	c
in	c
the	c
context	c
of	c
our	c
international	c

We	c
have	c
made	c
arrangements	c
for	c
you	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
Palace	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
since	c
it	c
is	c
located	c
between	c
the	c

and	c
our	c

,	c
a	c

The	c

is	c
to	c
be	c
held	c
at	c
the	c
'	c
Royal	c

of	c
the	c

has	c
an	c
outstanding	c

Therefore	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
three	c
hours	c
of	c
free	c

I	c
strongly	c
suggest	c
you	c

check	c

in	c
your	c
lugages	c

The	c
technological	c
revolution	c
taking	c
place	c
today	c
can	c
be	c
directly	c
linked	c
to	c
the	c
amazing	c
evolution	c
of	c
our	c
communication	c
abilities	c
throughout	c
those	c
last	c
years	c
.	c

The	c
inevitable	c
invention	c
symbolizing	c
this	c
aspect	c
in	c
our	c
ordinary	c
life	c
is	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
clear	c
and	c
irrefutable	c
that	c
the	c
use	c
of	c
this	c
invention	c
has	c
becomed	i
a	c
necessary	c
condition	i
in	c
some	c
professional	c
activities	c
.	c

Trades	c
,	c
politicians	c
and	c
taxi	c
drivers	i
are	c
but	c
a	c
few	c
examples	c
of	c
such	c
needs	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
common	c
man	c
seems	c
to	c
ignore	c
how	c
important	c
and	c
useful	c
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
becomes	c
,	c
when	c
in	c
the	c
hands	c
of	c
a	c
high	c
-	c
school	c
student	c
.	c

It	c
becomes	c
then	c
a	c
real	c
obsession	c
for	c
the	c
average	c
students	c
,	c
as	c
e	c
uses	c
it	c
before	c
the	c
lessons	c
,	c
during	c
the	c
lessons	c
,	c
during	c
lunch	c
and	c
,	c
especially	c
,	c
during	c
examinations	c
...	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
common	c
mistake	c
to	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
sole	c
purpose	c
of	c
such	c
an	c
usage	c
is	c
to	c
communicate	c
information	c
during	c
an	c
exam	c
,	c
since	c
its	c
major	c
role	c
is	c
actually	c
to	c
allow	c
the	c
student	c
and	c
the	c
parents	c
to	c
discuss	c
during	c
everyday	c
's	c
courses	c
.	c

Bottom	c
line	c
is	c
that	c
any	c
teacher	c
complaining	i
about	c
this	c
situation	c
should	c
confiscate	c
not	c

People	c

that	c

Thank	c

.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c

The	c

is	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
reasonably	c
near	c
to	c
the	c
college	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
may	c
be	c
very	c
good	c
to	c
walk	c
from	c
the	c
hotel	c
along	c
River	c
Thames	c
following	c
yellow	c
signs	c

If	c

you	c
can	c
take	c
bus	c
54	c
that	c
stops	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
college	c
.	c

The	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
is	c
designed	c
to	c
give	c
rough	c
ideas	c
about	c
many	c
different	c
cultures	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
will	c
enjoy	c
traditional	c
foods	i
,	c
music	c
,	c
dances	i
and	c
games	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
leader	c
of	c
each	c
group	c
has	c
to	c
wear	c
a	c
costume	c
of	c
her	c
country	c
.	c

Other	c
members	c
of	c
groups	c
can	c
wear	c
a	c
normal	c
pretty	c
formal	c
dress	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
recommend	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
visit	c
the	c
place	c
that	c
is	c
located	c
at	c
the	c
centre	c
of	c
our	c
city	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
about	c
1000	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
it	c
fascinating	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
your	c
life	c
without	c
any	c
computers	c
at	c
all	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
hardly	c
do	c
this	c
unless	c
you	c
are	c
living	c
deep	c
in	c
a	c
forest	c
or	c
in	c
a	c
dessert	c
!	c

If	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
how	c
many	c
computers	c
we	c
use	c
every	c
day	c
and	c
how	c
dependent	c
we	c
are	c
on	c
them	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
clear	c
that	c
invention	c
of	c
computers	c
has	c
certainly	c
had	c
a	c
significant	c
impact	c
on	c
all	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
all	c
infrastructures	c
such	c
as	c
transports	i
and	c
power	c
stations	c
are	c
ran	c
using	c
computers	c
government	c
uses	i
them	c
to	c
organise	c
all	c
sorts	c
of	c
things	c
in	c
a	c
country	c
,	c
and	c
all	c
kids	c
of	c
services	c
and	c
businesses	c
such	c
as	c
hospitals	c
and	c
supermarkets	c
use	c
them	c
as	c
essential	c
capitals	c
.	c

In	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
almost	c
all	c
aspects	c
of	c
our	c
lives	c
today	c
rely	c
on	c
computers	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
from	c
this	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
convincing	c
enough	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
invention	c
of	c
computers	c
is	c
really	c
important	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
personal	c
experience	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
also	c
say	c
that	c
a	c
personal	c
computer	c
is	c
also	c
an	c
amazing	c
tool	c
.	c

It	c
improves	c
productivity	c
of	c
my	c
homework	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
often	c
essay	c
writing	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
it	c
allows	c
me	c
to	c
access	c
to	c
the	c
internet	i
.	c

Since	c
I	c
live	i
abroad	c
,	c
the	c
internet	i
is	c
really	c
useful	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
contact	c
with	c
my	c
bestfriend	i
and	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
is	c
going	c
on	c
in	c
my	c
home	c
country	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
greatest	c
ever	c
invention	c
is	c
the	c
invention	c
of	c
computers	c
that	c
has	c
affected	c
both	c
indivisuals	c
and	c
a	c
society	c
as	c
a	c
whole	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c

.	c

The	c

on	c
31st	c
June	c
2001	c
from	c
10.00	c

15.00	c

Light	c

After	c
the	c
conference	c

there	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
relaxing	c
party	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
no	c
dressed	c
-	c
code	c
for	c
the	c
party	c
.	c

However	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
could	c
wear	c
the	c
same	c
outfit	c
as	c
you	c
wear	c
for	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
included	c
the	c
local	c
map	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
ideas	c
at	c
the	c
back	c
of	c
the	c
map	c
.	c

Please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
book	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
city	c
-	c
walk	c
tours	c
,	c
We	c
have	c
arrange	c
spacial	i
discounts	c
for	c
the	c
conference	c
attendance	c
.	c

Personly	c
I	c
recommend	c
the	c
Dicken	i
's	c
tour	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
length	c
of	c
walking	c
and	c
very	c
historical	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
covered	c
all	c
information	c
you	c
would	c
need	c
and	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

P.S.	c
Please	c
find	c
the	c
enclosed	c
map	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
several	c
interesting	c
buildings	c
in	c
the	c
city	c
of	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
Liverpool	c
Street	c
Station	c
is	c
at	c
the	c
top	c
list	c
.	c

The	c
building	c
itself	c
looks	c
grand	i
and	c
elegant	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
this	c
building	c
has	c
served	c
half	c
-	c
a	c
million	c
commuters	i
in	c
a	c
day	c
,	c
it	c
always	c
clean	c
and	c
functional	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
two	c
parts	c
of	c
Liverpool	c
Street	c
Station	c
that	c
make	c
it	c
so	c
interesting	c
building	c
.	c

The	c
newly	i
decorated	c
section	c
is	c
fairly	c
modern	c
style	c
with	c
escalators	i
and	c
touched	c
-	c
screen	c
ticket	c
machine	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
very	c
well	c
linked	c
into	c
the	c
old	c
underground	c
station	c
which	c
it	c
is	c
such	c
a	c
contrast	c
in	c
transformation	c
.	c

The	c
old	c
bit	c
is	c
rather	c
unique	c
and	c
charming	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
really	c
imagine	c
how	c
it	c
looked	c
like	c
in	c
the	c
old	c
day	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
another	c
surprising	c
section	c
in	c
this	c
building	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
far	c
back	c
of	c
the	c
station	c
is	c
also	c
connected	c
to	c
a	c
spacious	c
well	c
designed	c
pedestrians	c
park	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
example	c
of	c
a	c
great	c
architecture	c
that	c
was	c
designed	c
to	c
provide	c
services	c
to	c
the	c
public	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
in	c
the	c
heart	c
of	c
city	c
and	c
everyone	c
would	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
find	c
without	c
doubt	c

I	c
can	c
not	c
imagine	c
how	c
our	c
life	c
would	c
be	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
living	c
in	c
a	c
busy	c
world	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
business	c
world	c
you	c
use	c
the	c
phone	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
to	c
speak	c
with	c
your	c
clients	c
,	c
to	c
make	c
appointments	c
,	c
to	c
order	c
an	c
article	c
e.c	c
.	c
;	c
then	c
,	c
time	c
is	c
money	c
!	c

How	c
has	c
the	c
phone	c
affected	c
my	c
own	c
life	c
?	c
I	c
think	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
question	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
.	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
call	c
my	c
friends	c
from	c
an	c
other	c
city	c
and	c
just	c
say	c
\"	c
hello	c
\"	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
difficult	c
and	c
take	c
more	c
time	c
to	c
make	c
an	c
appointment	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
what	c
did	c
the	c
phone	c
-	c
revolution	c
for	c
us	c
?	c

It	c
saves	c
time	c

will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c

for	c
the	c
group	c
of	c
students	c
who	c
are	c
coming	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c

Firstly	c

the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
is	c
waiting	c
for	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
students	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
from	c
there	c
to	c
the	c
college	c
where	c
the	c
conference	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
is	c
simply	c
to	c
walk	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
the	c
college	c
is	c
situated	c
500	c
meters	c
away	c
from	c
the	c
Hotel	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
the	c
conference	c
will	c
be	c
followed	c
by	c
a	c
party	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
begin	c
at	c
7	c
p.m	c
and	c
last	c
until	c
late	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
worry	c
about	c
what	c
you	c
should	c
wear	c
to	c
this	c
event	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
the	c
purpose	c
of	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
is	c
to	c
relax	c
after	c
a	c
busy	c
day	c
,	c
therefore	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
students	c
can	c
put	c
jeans	c
and	c
sport	c
shoes	c
on	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
organize	c
a	c
guided	c
tour	c
by	c
coach	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
have	c
an	c
afternoon	c
free	c
before	c
your	c
plane	c
takes	c
off	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
the	c
international	c
student	c
conference	c
will	c
help	c
to	c
know	c
each	c
other	c
better	c
and	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
success	c

Dear	c

I	c
'm	c

There	c
is	c
so	c
many	c
places	c
of	c
interest	c
in	c
Lausanne	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
Olympic	i
Museum	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
notable	c
for	c
the	c
following	c
reasons	c
:	c

The	c
Olympic	i
Museum	c
dates	c
from	c
the	c
19th	c
century	c
and	c
is	c
the	c
biggest	c
in	c
Europe	c
.	c

It	c
shows	c
all	c
the	c
different	c
sports	c
men	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c
since	c
the	c
first	c
Olympic	i
Games	c
in	c
Greece	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
see	c
the	c
evolution	c
of	c
sports	c
and	c
understand	c
why	c
changes	c
gradually	i
have	c
been	c
done	c
to	c
improve	c
them	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
admire	c
every	i
kind	c
of	c
equipments	i
you	c
need	c
to	c
do	c
any	c
particular	c
sport	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
be	c
informed	c
about	c
the	c
story	c
of	c
sport	c
in	c
general	c
and	c
about	c
the	c
new	c
technologies	c
which	c
are	c
used	c
nowaday	i
n	i
high	c
competitions	c
.	c

The	c
museum	c
is	c
near	c
the	c
city	c
center	i
and	c
is	c
accessible	c
by	c
bus	c
or	c
walking	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
takes	c
you	c
an	c
afternoon	c
to	c
visit	c
it	c
and	c
then	c

When	c
Alexander	c
Graham	c
Bell	c
first	c
invented	c
the	c
telephone	c
,	c
he	c
had	c
no	c
idea	c
of	c
how	c
popular	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
one	c
day	c

Its	c
first	c
appliance	c
was	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
a	c
concert	c
if	c
you	c
were	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
attend	c
it	c
in	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
the	c
whole	c

connected	c
by	c
a	c

no	c

Take	c
me	c

for	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
use	c
it	c
whenever	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
problem	c
and	c
I	c
need	c
some	c

when	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
call	c
off	c
a	c

any	c

I	c
can	c
not	c
always	c
walk	c
to	c
the	c
person	c
and	c
say	c
\"	c
Sorry	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
cancel	c
our	c

is	c
n't	c
it	c

Life	c
definitely	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
without	c
the	c
invention	c
of	c
the	c
telephone	c

We	c
use	c
it	c
daily	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
get	c
information	c
or	c
to	c
pass	c
it	c
on	c

Just	c
try	c
to	c
spend	c
one	c
week	c
without	c
using	c
a	c
telephone	c
at	c
all	c

and	c
you	c
will	c
see	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
to	c
do	c

So	c
do	c
n't	c
take	c
the	c
telephone	c
for	c
granted	i
,	c
but	c
keep	c
in	c
mind	c
that	c
our	c
modern	c
way	c
of	c

is	c
mainly	c
due	c
to	c
its	c

The	c

:	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
car	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
human	c
inventions	c
that	c
has	c
the	c
most	c
affected	c
the	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
of	c
people	c
from	c
industrial	c
countries	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
more	c
than	c
the	c
percents	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
industry	c
is	c
related	c
to	c
the	c
automotive	c
business	c
:	c
car	c
manufacturing	c
,	c
gasoline	c
extracting	c
and	c
refining	c
,	c
tyres	i
recycling	i
,	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

The	c
industrial	c
countries	c
have	c
encountered	i
deep	c
evolution	c
of	c
their	c
strictures	c
since	c
the	c
car	c
has	c
been	c
made	c
available	c
to	c
everyone	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
last	c
Century	c
only	c
a	c
few	c
very	c
rich	c
people	c
could	c
afford	c
a	c
car	c
;	c
it	c
was	c
kind	c
of	c
leisure	c
or	c
sport	c
to	c
drive	c
one	c
.	c

Today	c
almost	c
everyone	c
owns	i
a	c
car	c
and	c
needs	c
it	c
for	c
daily	c
activities	c
.	c

The	c
transport	c
network	c
has	c
changed	c
according	c
to	i
this	c
social	c
evolution	c
.	c

The	c
increasing	c
number	c
of	c
cars	c
related	c
and	c
infrastructure	i
are	c
now	c
creeting	c
problems	c
.	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
roads	c
and	c
motorways	c
are	c
overcrowded	c
,	c
and	c
enviromment	c
issues	c
are	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
related	c
to	c
the	c
intensive	c
use	c
of	c
cars	c
and	c
lorries	c
.	c

People	c
and	c
governments	c
are	c
concerned	c
about	c
how	c
to	c
limit	i
the	c
effects	i
of	c
cars	c
on	i
the	c
enviromment	c
without	c
impacting	c
their	c
mobility	c

This	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
tough	c
challenge	c
for	c

I	c
received	c
your	c

day	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c

The	c

been	c
booked	c

Palace	c
Hotel	c
which	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
far	c
from	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
the	c
conference	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
take	c
the	c
No.41	c
bus	c
from	c
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
,	c
it	c
only	c
takes	c
ten	c
minutes	c
approximately	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
,	c
it	c
will	c

They	c
can	c
play	c

The	c

looks	c
very	c
old	c
as	c
some	c
other	c
buildings	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
but	c
it	c

story	c
or	c

you	c
a	c

definely	c
take	c

After	c
a	c

I	c
love	c

Baking	c
is	c
passion	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
town	c
I	c
live	c
I	c
'm	c
known	c
for	c
making	c
the	c
best	c
cakes	c
in	c
the	c
area	c

It	c
does	c
n't	c

mood	c
I	c
am	c

I	c

it	c

me	c
feel	c

But	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
bake	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c

I	c
think	c
the	c

one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
inventions	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
is	c
someone	c
who	c
does	c
n't	c
agree	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
live	c
one	c
month	c
without	c
using	c
the	c
oven	c
.	c

Besides	c
that	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
should	c
look	c
carefully	c
into	c
what	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
buys	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
positive	c
that	c
after	c
such	c
an	c
experience	c
everyone	c
says	c
that	c
the	c
oven	c
is	c
a	c
really	c
important	c
invention	c
for	c
our	c
lifes	i

People	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
the	c
impression	c
on	c
important	c
inventions	c
any	c
more	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
have	c
been	c
getting	c
more	c
popular	c
and	c
common	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
something	c
which	c
is	c
still	c
believed	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
an	c
extreamly	c
important	c
invention	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
electricity	c
invented	c
by	c
Edison	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
electricity	c
is	c
such	c
an	c
important	c
invention	c
is	c
that	c
most	c
of	c
machines	c
,	c
appliances	c
and	c
equipments	i
which	c
are	c
used	c
in	c
modern	c
times	c
can	c
be	c
operated	i
with	c
only	c
electricity	c
,	c
which	c
makes	c
people	c
not	c
to	c
too	c
much	c
phisical	i
labour	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
many	c
inventions	c
have	c
been	c
accelerated	c
by	c
electricity	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
I	c
use	c
electricity	c
in	c
many	c
different	c
ways	c
.	c

At	c
night	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
study	c
because	c
of	c
it	c
.	c
and	c
also	c
It	c
saves	c
my	c
time	c
which	c
would	c
be	c
used	c
up	c
for	c
doing	c
housework	c
such	c
as	c
laundry	c
,	c
cleaning	c
rooms	c
and	c
ironing	c
.	c

It	c
makes	c
my	c
life	c
more	c
convenient	c
than	c
that	c
without	c
it	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
although	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
feel	c
that	c
electricity	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
invention	c
any	c
more	c
,	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
electricity	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
inventions	c

Yours	c

I	c
can	c
live	c
without	c
this	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
true	c
.	c

In	c
our	c
lifes	i
,	c
may	c
be	c
,	c
could	c
n't	c
be	c
without	c
electricity	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
can	c
live	c
without	c
this	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
the	c
world	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
different	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
are	c
using	c
different	c
equipments	i
in	c
our	c
houses	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
using	c
the	c
electricity	c
.	c

Small	c
things	c
but	c
very	c
importants	i
in	c
our	c
lifes	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
:	c
T.V.	i
,	c
computer	c
,	c
just	c
light	c
and	c
a	c
long	c
list	c
that	c
now	c
I	c
can	c
not	c
write	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
tinking	i
,	c
my	c
house	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
without	c
all	c
this	c
facilities	c
.	c

In	c
winter	c
when	c
is	c
dark	c
very	c
early	c
,	c
and	c
after	c
,	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
spent	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
in	c
home	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
without	c
my	c
music	c
and	c
my	c
computer	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
just	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
would	c
do	c
or	c
what	c
would	c
happen	c
in	c
a	c
city	c
,	c
with	c
a	c
car	c
,	c
aeroplans	c
,	c
shoops	i
,	c
all	c
these	c
things	c
without	c
lights	i
.	c

Finally	c
.	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
everybody	c
know	c
that	c
the	c
electricity	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
invent	c
and	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c

people	c

comfortablely	c

If	c
you	c
ask	c
me	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
greatest	c
invention	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
television	c
.	c

\"	c
Televisions	c
is	c
just	c
an	c
amazing	c
invention	c
.	c
\"	c
My	c
good	c
friend	c
said	c
that	c
.	c
I	c
agree	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
televisions	c
make	c
us	c
know	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
world	c
without	c
travel	c
it	c
all	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
are	c
no	c
televisions	c
,	c
we	c
wo	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
are	c
the	c
other	c
countries	c
like	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
what	c
language	c
they	c
speak	c
unless	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
that	c
country	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
for	c
some	c
points	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
educate	c
young	c
children	c
.	c

Many	c
TV	c
programmes	c
are	c
especially	c
made	c
for	c
children	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
\"	c
Learn	c
follow	c
me	c
\"	c
and	c
\"	c
Be	c
good	c
to	c
others	c
\"	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
quite	c
good	c
programmes	c
and	c
helped	c

know	c
what	c
I	c
should	c
do	c
generally	c
or	c
how	c
to	c
behave	c
nicely	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
still	c
a	c
child	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
kind	c
of	c
entertainments	i
.	c

Maybe	c
you	c
will	c
think	c
that	c
playing	c
basketball	c
,	c
going	c
to	c
cinemas	c
and	c
discos	c
are	c
much	c
better	c
that	c
staying	c
at	c
home	c
sitting	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
an	c
object	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
televisions	c
can	c
bring	c
you	c
the	c
fun	c
that	c
other	c
activities	c
ca	c
n't	c
.	c

If	c
sometimes	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
lonely	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
easy	c
,	c
just	c
turn	c
on	c
the	c
television	c
and	c
enjoy	c
myself	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
everything	c
has	c
its	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
think	c
televisions	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
invention	c

By	c
the	c

my	c
town	c
and	c
send	c
my	c
regard	c
to	c
Richard	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Nowadays	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
inventions	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
make	c
us	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
convenient	c
.	c

Moreover	c
we	c
can	c
not	c
live	c
without	c
them	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
:	c
electricity	c
,	c
computer	c
,	c
telephon	i
,	c
boat	c
,	c
and	c
car	c
(	c
wheel	i
)	c
,	c
etc	c
.	c

None	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
unimportant	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
invention	c
of	c
electricity	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
among	c
them	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
look	c
around	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
electric	c
things	c
.	c

Electricity	c
could	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
invent	c
other	c
things	c
.	c

It	c
also	c
gave	c
us	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
,	c
especially	c
for	c
women	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
abosolutly	i
reduced	c
women	c
's	c
our	c
house	c
working	c
time	c
.	c

Evenmore	c
we	c
can	c
enjoy	c
our	c
night	c
with	c
lights	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
want	c
do	c
something	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
it	c
at	c
night	c
same	c
as	c
day	c
.	c

Finally	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
is	c
changed	c
by	c
electricity	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
reduce	c
our	c
working	c
time	c
and	c
make	c
us	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
advancing	i
more	c
and	c
more	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
give	c
us	c
better	c
future	c
!	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
imagined	c
that	c
you	c
would	c
drive	c
electric	c
car	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
describe	c
the	c
Haunted	c
Castle	c
in	c
Camberley	c
.	c

Place	c

This	c
castle	c
is	c
situated	c
in	c
the	c
centre	c
of	c
the	c
town	c
and	c
surrounded	c
by	c
woods	c
.	c

Inside	c
of	c
the	c
castle	c
is	c
always	c
dark	c
even	c
in	i
daytime	c
.	c

Story	c

It	c
is	c
500	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
said	c
to	c
be	c
haunted	c
by	c
a	c
lady	c
ghost	c
.	c

She	c
appears	i
occationaly	c
and	c
opens	c
every	c
window	c
in	c
the	c
castle	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
believed	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
a	c
nanny	c
who	c
worked	c
there	c
and	c
fell	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
window	c
.	c

People	c
said	c
she	c
was	c
seeking	i
something	c
and	c
still	c
seeking	i
even	c
if	c
she	c
had	c
dead	c
for	c
500	c
years	c
.	c

Conclusion	c

The	c
ghost	c
story	c
may	c
not	c
be	c
true	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
has	c
good	c
furniture	c
of	c
16th	c
century	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
castle	c
itself	c
is	c
very	c
beautiful	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
worth	c
while	c
to	c
see	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
enjoy	c
visiting	c
there	c

Dear	c

,	c

I	c
have	c
recieved	i
your	c
letter	c
this	c
morning	c

I	c
am	c
sorry	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
Richard	c
is	c
ill	c
and	c
is	c
unable	c
to	c
attempt	c
the	c
conference	c
;	c
I	c
am	c
glad	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
leader	i
of	c
the	c
group	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
these	c
informations	i
below	c
are	c
very	c
useful	c
to	c
you	c
,	c
during	c
your	c
attempt	c
of	c
conference	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
booked	c
a	c
hotel	c
not	c
far	c
off	c
from	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

The	c
hotel	c
is	c
called	c
Epsom	c
Down	c
Hotel	c
.	c

Your	c
plane	c
will	c
arrive	c
in	c
England	c
by	c
9:00	i
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
coach	c
waiting	c
for	c
you	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
driver	c
will	c
be	c

would	c
suggest	c
you	c

The	c
best	c
way	c
to	c

to	c
follow	c

entrance	c
of	c
the	c
collage	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
get	c
into	c
the	c
college	c
you	c
can	c
just	c
ask	c
any	c

the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
conference	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
a	c

Hall	c
.	c

Nearly	c
everyone	c
knows	c
where	c
this	c
building	c
is	c
,	c
so	c
if	c
you	c

a	c
chance	c
,	c
just	c
ask	c
the	c
local	c
people	c
in	c
Taipei	c
about	c
this	c
building	c
.	c

The	c
momerial	c

As	c

into	c
the	c
main	c
Hall	c
,	c
you	c

see	c
a	c
huge	c
statue	c
of	c
Chiang	i
Kei	i
-	c
shek	i
,	c
this	c
is	c
because	c
the	c
building	c

These	i
treasure	i
are	c

old	c
,	c
even	c
older	c
than	c
the	c
history	c
of	c
America	c
.	c

All	c
these	c
treasures	i
were	c
brought	c

They	c
are	c
all	c

As	c

When	c

might	c
want	c
to	c

WHY	c
THE	c
OLYMPIC	i
MUSEUM	c
.	c

The	c
Olympique	c
Museum	c
is	c
situated	c
near	c
the	c
lake	c
and	c
offer	c
,	c
for	c
the	c
tourist	c
,	c
an	c
unbelievable	c
view	c
on	c
the	c
mountains	c
and	c
the	c
lake	c

But	c
also	c

museum	c
have	c

the	c
architecture	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
is	c
beautiful	c
and	c
very	c
modern	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
interest	c
of	i
the	c
museum	c
is	c
the	c
olympic	i
history	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
find	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
documentary	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
several	c
competitors	c
personal	c
objects	c

In	c

,	c
you	c

with	c
several	c
interactive	c
game	i
and	c
learn	c
about	c
the	c
rules	c
of	c
the	c
olympic	i
games	c
.	c

REASONS	c
OF	c
RECOMMENDATION	c
.	c

The	c
principal	c
reason	c
is	c
the	c
cheapest	c
price	c
.	c

You	c
pay	c
only	c
to	c
FRS	c
for	c
the	c
entry	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
stay	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
more	c
than	c
10	c
people	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
group	c
price	c
and	c
pay	c
only	c
6	c
Frs	i
per	c
person	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
that	c
this	c
solution	c
might	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
visit	c
this	c
museum	c
.	c

CONCLUSION	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
the	c
Olympic	i
Museum	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
attractive	c
place	c
and	c
could	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
trip	c
with	c
your	c
family	c
or	c
your	c
student	c
group	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
learn	c
something	c
about	c
the	c
Olympic	i
Games	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
place	c

that	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
in	c
the	c
town	c
.	c

The	c
access	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
place	c
is	c
very	c
easy	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
you	c
must	c
walk	c
down	c
to	c
the	c
Central	c
Street	c
until	c
you	c
arrive	c
at	c
the	c
bus	c
stop	c
,	c
then	c
you	c
take	c
the	c
bus	c
number	c
two	c
that	c
goes	c
directly	c
to	c
the	c
college	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
conference	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
party	c
that	c
is	c
organised	c
by	c
friends	c
.	c

It	c
starts	c
at	c
twenty	c
o'clock	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
night	c
,	c
so	c
be	c

!	c

There	c
is	c
no	c
special	c
thema	c
for	c
the	c
wearing	c
style	c
but	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
more	c
fun	c
if	c

something	c
crazy	c
...	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c

Hello	c
,	c

I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
informations	i
on	c
the	c
yverdon	c
's	c
castle	c
.	c

This	c
building	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
oldest	c
that	c
stays	i
in	c
the	c
landscape	c
of	c
the	c
town	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
its	c
important	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
when	c
you	c
come	c
there	c
because	c
it	c
shows	c
us	c
how	c
the	c
town	c
had	i
been	i
developped	i
around	i
it	c
since	c
its	c
creation	i
.	c

Those	c
days	c
,	c
the	c
castle	c
is	c
being	c
remade	c
,	c
so	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
construction	c
engines	c
around	c
it	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
not	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
because	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
complete	c
museum	c
in	c
it	c
where	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
old	c
pictures	c
of	c
the	c
castle	c
during	c
the	c
centuries	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
old	c
items	c
that	c
were	c
in	c
the	c
King	c
's	c
family	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
probably	c
heard	c
about	c
the	c
mummy	c
who	c
sleeps	i
there	c
for	c
about	c
two	c
thousand	c
years	c
...	c
You	c
can	c
see	c
it	c
in	c
the	c
dungeon	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
can	c
visit	c
everywhere	c
you	c
want	c
with	c
or	c
without	c
a	c
guide	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
enjoy	c
the	c
visit	c
and	c
I	c
wish	c
you	c
a	c
nice	c
holliday	i
in	c
Yverdon	c
.	c

Best	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c

your	c

.	c

I	c
will	c
try	c
my	c
best	c
to	c
answer	c
the	c
questions	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
already	c
booked	c
the	c
Five	c
-	c
Stars	c
Hotel	c
for	c
your	c
group	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
modern	c
hotel	c
,	c
near	c
our	c
college	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
very	c
convenent	c
to	c
come	c
from	c
the	c
airport	c
.	c
You	c
can	c
take	c
both	c
by	c
buses	c
or	c
taxies	c
.	c

The	c
nember	c
101	c
bus	c
starts	c
from	c
the	c
airport	c
,	c
than	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
off	c
from	c
\"	c
city	c
college	c
\"	c
stop	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
chance	c
to	c
tark	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
party	c
for	c
everyone	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
just	c
a	c
relaxing	c
party	c
,	c
just	c
for	c
the	c
members	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
relax	c
and	c
make	c
friends	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
'd	c
better	c
to	c
wear	c
a	c
dress	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
about	c
the	c
free	c
three	c
hours	c
,	c
my	c
personal	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

Our	c
city	c
has	c
got	c
the	c
biggest	c
shoping	i
centre	c
in	c
South	c
England	c
,	c
there	c
gathers	c
so	c
many	c
shops	c
.	c

It	c
worthes	c
tp	c
spend	c
time	c
and	c
money	c
on	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Nowdays	i
people	c
have	c
become	i
used	c
to	c
watching	c
televesion	c
's	c
programs	c
everyday	i
.	c

The	c
TV	c
is	c
so	c
important	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
it	c
in	c
every	c
family	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
essential	c
equipment	c
for	c
everyone	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
al	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
TV	c
has	c
a	c
great	c
education	c
functions	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
makes	c
the	c
world	c
become	c
small	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
just	c
sit	c
at	c
home	c
then	c
you	c
can	c
know	c
what	c
is	c
happening	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
watching	c
the	c
news	c
on	c
TV	c
in	c
stead	i
of	c
reading	c
in	c
newspaper	c
or	c
hearing	c
on	c
radio	c
because	c
the	c
news	c
on	c
TV	c
are	c
vivid	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
TV	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
company	c
for	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
live	c
alone	c
or	c
feel	c
alone	c
.	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
open	c
TV	c
when	c
I	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Someone	c
are	c
talking	c
,	c
laughting	c
,	c
crying	c
on	c
there	c
,	c
so	c
join	c
them	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
feel	c
much	c
better	c
than	c
just	c
yourself	c
.	c

Some	c
TV	c
programs	c
are	c
enjouable	i
!	c

However	c
,	c
TV	c
also	c
has	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

You	c
might	c
just	c
sitting	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
TV	c
for	c
hours	c
learn	c
nothing	c
,	c
or	c
no	c
more	c
talk	c
with	c
your	c
family	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
badest	c
influence	c
in	c
the	c
society	c
.	c

In	c
clucsion	c
,	c
the	c
TV	c
has	c
both	c
advantages	c
and	c
disagvangtages	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
whole	c
advantages	c
is	c
greater	i
than	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
TV	c
still	c
is	c
a	c
wonderful	c
and	c
important	c
invention	c
on	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Dear	c

the	c
best	c
way	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Bill	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
an	c
information	c
on	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
building	c
to	c
visit	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
called	c
Penrhyh	c
Castle	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
building	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
all	c
about	c
Wales	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
positive	c
side	c
,	c
you	c
and	c
the	c
group	c
will	c
be	c
abe	c
to	c
learn	c
more	c
about	c
Welsh	c
art	c
works	c
which	c
are	c
presented	c
on	c
the	c
wall	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
door	c
and	c
some	c
furnitures	i
.	c

The	c
building	c
itself	c
looks	c
splendid	c
and	c
beautiful	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
find	c
something	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
boring	c
such	c
as	c
walking	c
along	c
the	c
old	c
wooden	c
floor	c
which	c
causes	c
some	c
noise	c
.	c

And	c
some	c
old	c
toilets	i
might	c
look	i
awlful	i
.	c

But	c
in	c
my	c
recommendation	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
for	c
the	c
students	c
to	c
come	c
and	c
see	c
this	c
building	c
.	c

Because	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
learn	c
and	c
compare	c
with	c
the	c
place	c
in	c
their	c
country	c
.	c

As	c
Wales	c
is	c
not	c
modern	c
like	c
America	c
,	c
so	c
the	c
students	c
will	c
probably	c
get	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
looking	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
old	c
things	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c

Firstly	c

we	c

booked	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
located	c
in	c
Central	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
from	c
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
its	c
using	c
tube	c
because	c
it	c
takes	c
only	c
20	c
mininute	c
.	c

The	c
tube	c
is	c
2	c
line	i
which	c
is	c
red	c
colour	c
.	c

And	c
your	c
speach	c

another	c
clothes	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
suggestions	c
which	c
could	c
spend	c
for	c
about	c
3	c
hours	c
in	c
the	c
national	c
museum	c
in	c
my	c
area	c
.	c

The	c
museum	c
can	c
be	c
helpful	c
to	c
understand	c
our	c
country	c
's	c
history	c
and	c
art	c
.	c

I	c
look	c

Computer	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
invention	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
might	c
say	c
the	c
electricity	c
more	c
important	c
than	c
another	c
thingh	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
hard	c
to	c
say	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
invention	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
say	c
computer	c
is	c
more	c
amazing	c
invention	c
rather	c
than	c
another	c
inventions	c
such	c
as	c
the	c
telephone	c
,	c
the	c
car	c
.	c

Recently	c
computer	c
is	c
really	c
necessary	c
and	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
manage	c
to	c
work	c
without	c
them	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
is	c
for	c
bussiness	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
in	c
for	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
contanct	c
with	c
to	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
quite	c
helpful	c
by	c
using	c
e	c
-	c
mail	c
.	c

Before	c
computer	c
had	c
been	c
invented	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
possibly	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
information	c
easily	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
contact	c
with	c
to	c
foreign	c
countries	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
it	c
's	c
time	c
to	c
make	c
new	c
system	c
which	c
makes	c
us	c
use	c
easier	c
and	c
more	c
simple	c
,	c
so	c
far	c
more	c
people	c
can	c
enjoy	c
computer	c
more	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

Despite	c
amazing	c
invention	c
,	c
some	c
times	c
computer	c
makes	c
big	c
problem	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
millennium	c
bug	c
(	c
some	c
people	c
called	c
\"	c
2000	c
problem	c

)	c
,	c
because	c
computer	c
not	c
flexible	c
enough	c
like	c
a	c
human	c
's	c
brain	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
computer	c
is	c
worth	c

call	c
me	c
up	c
.	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
an	c
interesting	c
conference	c
here	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
seeing	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
telephone	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
invention	c

In	c
my	c
early	c
childhood	c
my	c
mother	c
said	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
when	c
she	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
litte	i
girl	i
there	c
has	i
been	c
only	c
one	c
telephone	c
in	c
the	c
house	c
where	c
she	c
had	c
lived	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
been	c
in	c
her	c
parents	c
'	c
appartement	c
.	c

The	c
neighbours	c
had	c
come	c
into	c
to	c
make	c
their	c
calls	c
and	c
to	c
get	c
their	c
calls	c
.	c

Todays	i
nobody	c
could	c
imagine	c
such	c
a	c
situation	c
.	c

In	c
every	c
household	i
there	c
is	c
a	c
telephone	c
at	c
least	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
advantages	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

Firstly	c
people	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
person	c
on	c
every	c
time	c
.	c
Be	c
it	c
:	c
just	c
for	c
fun	c
or	c
also	c
to	c
discuss	c
some	c
important	c
and	c
relevant	c
thins	c
.	c

Moreover	c
we	c
always	c
can	c
call	c
for	c
help	c
to	c
the	c
police	c
,	c
to	c
the	c
hospital	c
or	c
to	c
a	c
doctor	c
.	c

This	c
could	c
save	c
life	c
!	c

An	c
other	c
advantage	c
is	c
that	c
all	c
offices	c
,	c
firms	c
and	c
industries	c
could	c
not	c
further	c
exist	c
without	c
it	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
there	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
big	c
disadvantage	c
.	c

All	c
people	c
know	c
this	c
situation	c
;	c
people	c
want	c
not	c
to	c
be	c
interrupted	c
,	c
maybe	c
they	c
are	c
reading	c
a	c
book	c
,	c
having	c
a	c
good	c
talk	c
or	c
are	c
having	c
a	c
little	c
sleep	c
...	c
then	c
the	c
telephone	c
rings	c
...	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
an	c
easy	c
desicion	i
how	c
to	c
react	c
now	c
.	c

Being	c
sincere	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
telephone	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
of	c
disadvantage	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
mobile	c
phones	c
are	c
ringing	c
.	c
everywhere	c
and	c
on	c
every	c
time	c
.	c

Especially	c
youngsters	c
misuse	i
this	c
kind	c
of	c
invention	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
this	c
invention	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
useful	c
things	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
always	c
the	c
same	c
how	c
to	c
people	c
use	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
and	c
how	c
people	c
handle	c
it	c
.	c

where	c
the	c
conference	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
held	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
best	c
choise	i
for	c
you	c
is	c
to	c
take	c

The	c
bus	c

you	c
should	c

is	c
called	c
\"	c
The	c
Green	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
from	c
8:00	c
until	c
midnight	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
the	c
necessary	c
dress	c
code	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
an	c
evening	c
dress	c
for	c
women	c
and	c
black	c
trousers	c
,	c
a	c
white	c

and	c
a	c
black	c
bow	c
tie	c
for	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
suggestions	c
about	c
way	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
can	c
spend	c
your	c
free	c
time	c
in	c
our	c
town	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
strongly	c
convinced	c
,	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
visit	c
local	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

Also	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
shopping	c
center	i
next	c
to	c
the	c
museum	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
your	c
at	c
the	c
conference	c
and	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
in	c
our	c
town	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

As	c
it	c
is	c
widely	c
known	c
,	c
lots	c
of	c
different	c
and	c
important	c
things	c
were	c
invented	c
during	c
the	c
20th	c
century	c
,	c
nevertheless	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
one	c
is	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
fact	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
modern	c
society	c
have	c
created	c
the	c
demand	c
for	c
the	c
ability	c
to	c
cope	c
with	c
the	c
vast	c
amounts	c
of	c
information	c
.	c

Taking	c
it	c
into	c
consideration	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
computer	c
is	c
the	c
priceless	c
invention	c
for	c
an	c
accountants	c
,	c
designers	c
,	c
engineers	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
and	c
on	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
in	c
favour	c
is	c
the	c
possibility	c
to	c
connect	c
to	c
the	c
Internet	i
.	c

It	c
allows	c
you	c
to	c
have	c
all	c
the	c
necessary	c
information	c
\"	c
on	c
your	c
fingertips	c
\"	c
.	c

Also	c
not	c
least	c
importantly	c
is	c
the	c
role	c
of	c
computers	c
in	c
the	c
process	c
of	c
production	c
in	c
factories	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
children	c
nowadays	c
replace	c
their	c
real	c
life	c
with	c
the	c
virtual	c
world	c
,	c
which	c
computers	c
create	c
.	c

Another	c
drawback	c
is	c
that	c
in	c
industry	c
computers	c
replace	i
people	c
's	c
labour	c
,	c
which	c
leads	i
to	c
the	c
increasing	c
of	i
unemployment	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
goverments	c
of	c
all	c
developed	c
countries	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
been	c
so	c
concerned	c
about	c
so	c
-	c
called	c
\"	c
problem	c
2000	c
\"	c
if	c
the	c
computer	c
had	c
not	c
been	c
so	c
important	c
for	c
the	c
modern	c

Everything	c

To	c
learn	c
the	c
whole	c
history	c
of	c

there	c
is	c
a	c

recommend	c

the	c

even	c
the	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
owner	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c

past	c
people	c
used	c

Conclusion	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
add	c
that	c
this	c
house	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
famous	c
in	c
our	c
city	c

You	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
disappointed	c

The	c
only	c
negative	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
10	c

to	i
visit	c
