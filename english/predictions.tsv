Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Competition	c
Organiser	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
recieved	i
the	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
lets	c
me	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c

I	c
am	c
proud	c
of	c
winning	c
it	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
how	c
thankful	i
I	c
am	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
therefore	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
further	c
information	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c

Because	c
I	c
intend	c
to	c
take	c
examination	c
in	c
Septenber	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
can	c
afford	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
log	c
cabins	c
rather	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
my	c
first	c
time	c
to	c
experience	c
to	c
stay	c
there	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
trying	c
new	c
things	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
tried	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
consideration	c
is	c
the	c
activities	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
for	c
6	c
years	c
and	c
am	c
quite	c
confident	c
of	c
it	c

And	c
nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	i
practicing	c
tennis	c
as	c
school	c
activity	c

Therefore	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
considering	c
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
wear	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
most	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
further	c
advicable	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Hello	c
!	c
I	c
hope	c
everything	c
around	c
you	c
is	c
alright	c
.	c

You	c
might	c
not	c
believe	c
but	c
actually	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
so	c
much	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
'm	c
now	c
writing	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
how	c
grateful	c
it	c
was	c
.	c

All	c
work	c
I	c
needed	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c
which	c
I	c
must	c
have	c
set	c
thousands	c
chairs	c
correctly	c
and	c
after	c
finishing	c
I	c
put	c
them	c
back	c
nicely	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
meet	c
the	c
vocalist	c
on	c
setting	c
chairs	c
just	c
before	c
they	c
started	c
practicing	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
asked	c
if	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
sit	c
down	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
stage	c
.	c

Naturally	c
I	c
agreed	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
their	c
gig	c
as	c
audience	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
absolutely	c
fantastic	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
ever	c
never	c
sit	i
down	i
there	c
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
vocalist	c
said	c
\"	c
All	c
the	c
chairs	c
you	c
are	c
sitting	c
down	c
were	c
set	c
from	c
him	c
,	c
\"	c

Actually	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
ashamed	c
but	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
my	c
brilliant	c
memory	c
.	c

Anyway	c
it	c
was	c
so	c
interesting	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
feel	c
tired	c
after	c
that	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
should	c
try	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
opportunity	c
.	c
You	c
must	c
like	c
it	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
send	c
me	c
the	c
letter	c
back	c
writing	c
what	c
happend	i
to	c
you	c
recently	c
.	c

Bye	c
!	c

Love	c
,	c

At	c
the	c
begining	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
informations	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
in	c
High	c
school	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
most	c
important	c
year	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
I	c
am	c
studying	c
to	c
university	c
entrance	c
exams	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
study	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
then	c
by	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
having	c
university	c
entrance	c
exam	c
after	c
that	c
in	c
July	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
alright	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
before	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
wondering	c
how	c
it	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
like	c
And	c
among	c
these	c
activities	c
I	c
am	c
choosing	c
basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

Basketball	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
,	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
swim	c
very	c
much	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
swimmer	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

My	c
first	c
question	c
is	c
about	c
clothes	c
;	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
us	c
?	c
and	c
How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
take	c

Finally	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
wheather	i
is	i
waiting	i
for	c
us	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
Every	c
thing	c

May	c

Dear	c
M.	c
Smith	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Marie	c
Bouchard	c
,	c
I	c
come	c
from	c
Switzerland	c

Two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
in	c
your	c
fabulous	c
city	c
of	c
London	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c

On	c
Thursday	c
,	c
the	c
3rd	c
of	c
May	c
2000	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
\"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
\"	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
really	c
disappointed	c
about	c
everything	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
got	c
our	c
tickets	c
in	c
your	c
ticket	c
office	c
just	c
one	c
hour	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
thought	c
,	c
as	c
usual	c
we	c
do	c
in	c
London	c
theatre	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
have	c
discounts	c
as	c
it	c
's	c
written	c
on	c
your	c
advertisement	c

Surprisily	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounds	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
theatre	c
but	c
not	c
a	c
concert	c
hall	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
astonished	c
about	c
the	c
actors	c
whose	c
we	c
know	c
from	c
others	c
musical	c
.	c

Why	c
did	c
you	c
not	c
change	c
the	c
name	c
of	c
your	c
advertisement	c
?	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
enough	i
staffs	i
,	c
this	c

Nothing	c
was	c
serious	c
.	c

We	c
really	c
like	c
London	c
,	c
the	c
people	c
,	c
the	c
night	c
-	c
life	c
but	c
this	c
evening	c
was	c

I	c
sent	c
to	c
you	c
a	c
copie	c
of	c
our	c
tickets	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
pleased	c
return	c
our	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

In	c
advance	c
,	c
thank	c
you	c

I	c
hope	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
the	c
only	c
people	c
to	c
be	c
so	c
upset	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
and	c
the	c
last	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
came	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c

Sincerely	c
yours	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

When	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
Scala	c
,	c
asked	c
her	c
an	c
idea	c
to	c
surprise	c
her	c
husband	c
because	c
she	c
's	c
pregnant	c
,	c
Pat	c
put	c
her	c
feets	c
in	c
the	c
plate	c
just	c
before	c
Scala	c
's	c
husband	c
got	c
the	c
surprise	c

The	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
Pat	c
works	c
in	c
the	c
Neubathin	c
a	c
little	c
village	c
.	c

She	c
's	c
a	c
secretary	c
in	c
an	c
office	c
.	c

Everybody	c
knows	c
everybody	c
.	c

Pat	c
and	c
Scala	c
have	c
been	c
good	c
friends	c
for	c
10	c
years	c
,	c
their	c
husband	c
too	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
Friday	c
suny	c
afternoon	c
,	c
Scala	c
was	c
really	c
excited	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
the	c
new	c

Despite	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
Pat	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
secret	c
but	c
for	c
this	c
time	c
she	c
was	c
confident	c
maybe	c
too	c
.	c

Just	c
after	c
Scala	c
told	c
her	c
the	c
new	c
,	c
Pat	c
phoned	c
her	c
mother	c
who	c
worked	c
in	c
a	c
bakery	c
,	c
to	c
tell	c
that	c
Scala	c
is	c
pregnant	c
.	c

As	c
usual	c
,	c
Jon	c
,	c
Scala	c
's	c
husband	c
came	c
&	c
bought	c
the	c
bread	c
for	c

Pat	c
's	c
mum	c
was	c
so	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
baby	c
,	c
she	c
just	c
said	c
\"	c
Congratulations	c
for	c
the	c
new	c
baby	c

He	c
was	c
so	c
amazed	c
and	c
asked	c
to	c
repeat	c
.	c

She	c
just	c
thought	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
secret	c
,	c
she	c
came	c
really	i
embarassed	c

When	c
he	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
his	c
house	c
,	c
his	c
wife	c
gave	c
him	c
the	c
box	c
with	c
the	c
shoes	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
surprise	c
!	c

Scala	c
was	c
hungry	c
with	c
Pat	c
because	c
she	c
thought	c
she	c
can	c
keep	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
secret	c
.	c

Sir	c
manager	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
on	c
the	c
newspaper	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
disappointed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
horrible	c
evening	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
time	c
enough	c
to	c
spend	c
there	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
show	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c

When	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
a	c
discount	c
and	c
they	c
said	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
problem	c
because	c
if	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
it	c
would	c
cost	c
what	c
they	c
said	c
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
in	c
time	c
and	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
started	c
later	c
than	c
I	c
expected	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
getting	c
nervous	c
because	c
I	c
dislike	c
very	c
much	c
the	c
impuntuality	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
was	c
not	c
all	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
was	c
acting	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
he	c
seemed	c
not	c
to	c
be	c
an	c
actor	c
.	c

Really	c
he	c
was	c
bad	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
meal	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
It	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
I	c
felt	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
irritating	c
evening	c
out	c
I	c
had	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
letting	c
down	c
because	c
of	c
your	c
behaviour	c
.	c

You	c
wanted	c
to	c
cheat	c
me	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
pleasure	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
my	c
money	c
back	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Your	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
the	c
way	c
of	c
living	c
of	c
almost	c
all	c
people	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
technology	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
nowadays	c
but	c
really	c
I	c
dislike	c
it	c
because	c
in	c
some	c
ways	c
we	c
are	c
becoming	c
machines	c
too	c
.	c

Since	c
the	c
creation	c
of	c
PCs	i
,	c
people	c
-	c
and	c
me	c
too	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
-	c
are	c
making	c

For	c
example	c
we	c
can	c
buy	c
food	c
,	c
clothes	c
and	c
whatever	c
we	c
need	c
by	c
internet	i
or	c
by	c
telephone	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
know	c
what	c
is	c
happening	c
in	c
differents	i
parts	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
.	c

A	c
very	c
good	c
point	c
of	c
this	c
change	c
is	c
that	c
women	c
have	c
more	c
freedom	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
job	c
because	c
before	c
reaching	c
the	c
technology	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
doing	c
housework	c
but	c
now	c
we	c
have	c
laundries	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
machines	c
like	c
microwave	c
oven	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
case	c
I	c
dislike	c
computers	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
them	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
because	c
they	c
help	c
us	c
to	c
make	c
our	c
lives	c
easier	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
what	c
will	c
happen	c
with	c
us	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
?	c

Our	c
life	c
will	c
be	c
managed	c
by	c
robots	c
and	c
they	c
will	c
replace	c
us	c
in	c
our	c
jobs	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
what	c
are	c
we	c
going	c
to	c
do	c

Something	c
that	c
I	c
note	c
about	c
technology	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
loosing	c
green	c
places	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
pollution	c
,	c
so	c
we	c

weeks	c

helps	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
me	c
better	c
.	c

I	c
would	c

About	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
tents	c

be	c
great	c
.	c

Basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
I	c
think	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
for	c
the	c
children	c

Basketball	c
will	c
help	c
children	c
to	c
build	c
team	c
character	c
and	c
leadership	c
.	c

And	c
swimming	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
for	c
health	c
.	c

I	c
swim	c
really	c
good	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
proffesional	i
basketball	i
player	i
.	c

I	c
count	c
on	c
my	c
experience	c
.	c

And	c
there	c
are	c
few	c
questions	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
what	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	c

how	c
much	c
money	c
and	c
by	c
cash	c
or	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
concert	c
of	c
\"	c
Modern	c
Talking	c
''	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
share	c
with	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
.	c

It	c
all	c
started	c
when	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
organizers	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
help	c
him	c
at	c
a	c
concert	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	c
band	i
.	c

And	c
what	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
answered	c
?	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
yes	c
!	c

I	c
have	c
got	c
very	c
responsible	c
work	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
bring	c
food	c
for	c
Peter	c
Bolen	c
and	c
Tomas	c
Anders	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
?	c

I	c
came	c
into	c
their	c
room	c
and	c
give	c
hot	c
Cheeseburgers	c
,	c
Coca	c
-	c
Cola	c
and	c
ice	c
-	c
cream	c
to	c
Peter	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
happiest	c
moment	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

He	c
asked	c
me	c
was	c
the	c
cheeseburger	c
hot	c
and	c
I	c
answered	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
talking	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
me	c
about	c
concert	c
programme	c
and	c
gave	c
me	c
his	c
photo	c
with	c
a	c
sign	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
that	c
summer	c
day	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
my	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
about	c
it	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
is	c
all	c

See	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Vasiliy	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
after	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
10.15	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

After	c
your	c
show	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
do	c

Also	c
,	c
you	c
wrote	c
about	c
discounts	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
not	c

The	c
woman	c
,	c
who	c
sold	c
a	c
ticket	c
was	c
very	c
roud	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
actually	c
she	c
started	c
swearing	c
at	c

During	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
hungry	c
but	c
I	c
hoped	c
to	c
visit	c
restaurant	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
pity	c
,	c
but	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c

And	c
,	c
I	c
forget	c
to	c
say	c
about	c
actor	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
enjoy	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
out	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
!	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c

your	c
sincerely	c

Ongelina	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
but	c
any	c
way	c
I	c
trusted	c
him	c

It	c
's	c
happened	c
3	c
months	c
ago	c
,	c
and	c
during	c
this	c
months	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
upset	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
,	c
his	c
name	c
Peter	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c

One	c
day	c
Peter	c
killed	c
one	c
boy	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
just	c
playing	c
and	c
be	c
acsident	c
,	c
Peter	c
shoot	c
him	c

I	c
was	c
there	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
it	c

I	c
hoped	c
that	c
it	c
,	c
just	c
could	c
see	c
3	c
people	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c

Pat	c
saw	c
it	c
!	c

We	c
spoke	c
with	c
Pat	c
many	c
times	c
to	c
keep	c
this	c
secret	c
,	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c

We	c
trusted	c
him	c

At	c
first	c
several	c
days	c
,	c
Pat	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
was	c
with	c
us	c

He	c
promised	c
to	c
keep	c
secret	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
morning	c
we	c
had	c
arguiment	c
with	c
Pat	c
,	c
3	c
of	c
us	c
were	c
shouting	c
at	c
each	c
other	i
,	c
in	c
shorter	c
Pat	c
went	c
away	c
from	c
us	c

Two	c
days	c
later	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
,	c
the	c
policeman	c
came	c
to	c
Peter	c

So	c
,	c
now	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
is	c
prisoner	c

All	c
the	c
time	c
I	c
am	c
thinking	c
about	c
Peter	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
him	c
.	c

He	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
prison	c
5	c
years	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
see	c
Pat	c
about	c
one	c
year	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
,	c
he	c
moved	c
into	c
another	c
town	c

It	c
's	c
good	c
that	c
he	c
far	c
away	c
...	c
I	c
miss	c
Peter	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
unfair	c
to	c
put	c
him	c
in	c
a	c
prison	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
's	c
life	c
,	c
destiny	c
,	c
very	c
cruel	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
regarding	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
sent	c
me	c
,	c
about	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
that	c
I	c
won	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
2	c
weeks	c
off	c
in	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
month	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
adventure	c
and	c
simplicity	c

Concerning	c
the	c
available	c
activities	c
,	c
firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
climbing	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
practised	c
it	c
for	c
many	c
years	c

Secondely	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	i
discovering	c
something	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
some	c
special	c
clothes	c
are	c
required	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
pocket	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
for	c
this	c
trip	c
?	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
in	c
advanced	c
and	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
relate	c
my	c
experience	c
in	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
had	c
a	c
such	c
good	c
time	c
in	c
my	c
life	c

The	c
day	c
one	c
consisted	c
in	c
surrounding	i
the	c
festival	c
's	c
place	c
with	c
fences	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
day	c
objective	c
was	c
to	c
install	c
the	c
scene	i
,	c
with	c
lights	i
,	c
loudspeakers	c
and	c
all	c
stuff	c

This	c
job	c
was	c
quite	c
hard	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
took	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
be	c
not	c
exhausted	c
!	c

The	c
last	c
day	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
the	c
concert	c
day	c
was	c
absolutely	c
fantastic	c
.	c

The	c
public	c
was	c
so	c
excited	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
concert	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
place	c
some	c
bouncer	c
front	i
of	c
the	c
scene	i
,	i
to	c
avoid	c
the	c
people	c
coming	c
on	c
the	c
concert	c
floor	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
concert	c
was	c
exactly	c
that	c
the	c
people	c
were	c
expected	c

I	c
hop	i
that	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
you	c
will	c
come	c
with	c
me	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	c
impressions	c
about	c
this	c
!	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
personal	c
opinion	c
about	c
the	c
'	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
.	c
'	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
whole	c
festival	c
was	c
a	c
greatful	i
success	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
think	c
you	c
chose	c
an	c
appropriate	c
title	c
for	c
the	c
leaflet	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
points	c
which	c
can	c
be	c
improved	c
for	c
the	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
you	c
wrote	c
down	c
in	c
the	c
leaflet	c
that	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
could	c
be	c
seen	c
in	c
the	c
performance	c
in	c
fact	c
their	c
were	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
involved	c
.	c

My	c
suggestion	c
for	c
this	c
point	c
is	c
to	c
invite	c
more	c
people	c
from	c
different	c
countries	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
is	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
definitely	c
to	c
small	c
or	c
in	c
other	c
words	c
to	c
many	c
people	c
attended	c
those	c
concerts	c
.	c

This	c
kind	c
of	c
problem	c
you	c
could	c
avoid	c
when	c
you	c
look	c
for	c
big	c
halls	c
at	c
the	c
begining	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
where	c
you	c
could	c
improve	c
is	c
when	c
you	c
show	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Nearly	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
idea	c
with	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
really	c
good	c
because	c
it	c
gave	c
to	c
the	c
people	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
attemp	c
a	c
whole	c
weekend	c
for	c
a	c
cheap	c
price	c
.	c

To	c
finish	c
this	c
letter	c
with	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
if	c
you	c
create	c
an	c
exhibition	c
place	c
where	c
the	c
guests	c
can	c
try	c
to	c
play	c
different	c
instruments	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

How	c
can	c
you	c
earn	c
money	c
in	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
everybody	c
will	c
ask	c
himself	c
this	c
question	c
one	c
day	c
or	c
has	c
already	c
asked	c
it	c
.	c

Anyway	c
the	c
people	c
where	c
asked	c
this	c
question	c
probably	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
so	c
easy	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
or	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
sometimes	c
to	c
much	c
work	c
.	c

A	c
traditional	c
way	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
spare	c
time	c
,	c
is	c
to	c
bring	c
newspapers	c
or	c
magazines	c
to	c
the	c
families	c
in	c
your	c
town	c
or	c

The	c
problems	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
here	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
rainy	c
,	c
because	c
then	c
everything	c
get	c
wet	c
.	c

Another	c
suggestion	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
cinema	c
and	c
ask	c
if	c
they	c
need	c
your	c
help	c
for	c
changing	c
the	c
film	c
rolls	c
,	c
for	c
cleaning	c
the	c
toilets	i
or	i
to	c
do	c
some	c
other	c
small	c
jobs	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
the	c
case	c
that	c
you	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
interesting	c
work	c
in	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
you	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
sell	c
something	c
where	c
you	c
're	c
good	c
at	c
,	c
I	c
mean	c
if	c
you	c
're	c
interested	c
in	c
computers	c
you	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
provide	c
your	c
service	c
for	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
in	c
the	c
begining	i
it	c
is	c
hard	c
but	c
you	c
can	c
learn	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
're	c
good	c
at	c
you	c
'll	c
also	c
earn	c
some	c
money	c
.	c

Okay	c
do	c
n't	c
wait	c
,	c
there	c
where	c
you	c
're	c
good	c
at	c
and	c
begin	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
/	c
madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
regard	i
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
.	c

During	c
my	c
2	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
attend	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
my	c
favorite	i
play	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
hopefull	i
that	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
were	c
many	c
things	c
which	c
went	c
wrong	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
no	c
discount	c
at	c
paying	c
.	c
secondly	c
there	c
was	c
delay	c
which	c
got	c
me	c
into	c
trouble	c
,	c
After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
catch	c
my	c
train	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
plan	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
lunch	c
in	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

The	c
worst	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
watch	c
my	c
favorite	i
actor	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
dissapointted	c
with	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
consentrate	c
on	c
the	c
play	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

Contrary	c
to	c
the	c
advertisment	i
everything	c
was	c
disapointing	i
.	c

I	c
regret	c
to	c
demand	c
all	c
my	c
expenses	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
take	c
into	c
consideration	c
my	c
terrible	c
situation	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
a	c
satisfactory	c
answer	c

Technology	c
has	c
developed	c
increasingly	c
in	i
recent	c
years	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
of	c
this	c
our	c
society	c
has	c
changed	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
technology	c
has	c
made	c
our	c
lives	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
easier	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
we	c
have	c
faced	c
some	c
problems	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
social	c
and	c
environmental	c
problems	c

Nowadays	c
students	c
have	c
much	c
more	c
facilitis	c
in	c
education	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

Although	c
in	c
those	c
days	c
the	c
only	c
way	c
of	c
learning	c
was	c
reading	c
.	c

These	c
days	c
we	c
can	c
use	c
computer	c
,	c
television	c
and	c
some	c
sophisticated	c
equipment	c
.	c
which	c
were	c
unusuall	c

Than	c
to	c
technology	c
we	c
can	c
reach	c
any	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
easily	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
get	c
some	c
information	c
more	c
quickly	c
.	c

Technology	c
has	c
a	c
huge	c
effect	c
on	c
our	c
spare	c
time	c
activities	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Children	c
play	c
wit	c
computer	c
instead	c
of	c
usuall	i
plays	i
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
huge	c
facilities	c
technology	c
has	c
affected	c
our	c
lives	c
negatively	c
.	c

There	c
has	c
been	c
change	c
relatinships	c
between	c
people	c
.	c

People	c
are	c
getting	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
lonely	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
noticed	c
the	c
environmential	c
damage	c
in	c
recent	c
years	c
.	c

While	c
we	c
are	c
using	c
technology	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
take	c
into	c
consideration	c
environment	c

We	c
should	c
n't	c
allow	c
to	c
be	c
exploited	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
leave	c
a	c
good	c
world	c
to	c
the	c
next	c
generations	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
behave	c
more	c
respectfully	c
againgst	c
the	c
nature	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
italian	c
student	i
who	c
has	c
come	c
to	c
the	c
last	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
possibility	c
to	c
see	c
and	c
to	c
love	c
the	c
art	c
,	c
but	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
also	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
things	c
thas	c
could	c
be	c
changed	c

I	c
noticed	c
that	c
the	c
artists	c
were	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
insted	c
that	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

This	c
choice	c
does	c
n't	c
give	c
many	i
artists	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
expresse	c
themself	i
.	c

Some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
and	c
often	c
people	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
the	c
performances	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
many	c
events	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
few	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

Maybe	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
put	c
more	c
of	c
them	c
in	c
the	c
programme	c
because	c
they	c
like	c
so	c
much	c
to	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

The	c
very	c
about	c
young	c
people	c
,	c
the	c
choice	c
to	c
offer	c
a	c
reasonably	c
-	c
priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
is	c
a	c
excellent	c
idea	c
because	c
it	c
brings	c
them	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
contact	c
with	c
all	c
what	c
it	c
art	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
my	c
opinion	c
can	c
help	c
you	c
to	c
set	c
fro	i
the	c
next	c
year	c
a	c
great	c
internation	i
arts	c
festival	c
alone	c
to	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
and	c
greetings	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
money	c
it	c
's	c
work	c
in	c
a	c
fast	c
-	c
food	c

Maybe	c
the	c
first	c
impression	c
is	c
n't	c
positive	c
but	c
from	c
my	c
personal	c
experience	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
job	c
is	c
right	c
for	c
get	c
some	c
money	c
.	c

For	c
six	c
months	c
I	c
've	c
worked	c
in	c
a	c
McDonald	c
's	c
restaurant	c
in	c
Italy	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
lots	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
worked	c
eight	c
hours	c
every	c
day	c
but	c
in	c
every	c
fast	c
-	c
food	c
you	c
can	c
work	c
part	c
-	c
time	c
,	c
four	c
,	c
three	c
,	c
six	c

It	c
depends	c
on	c
what	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

This	c
kind	c
of	c
job	c
is	c
perfect	c
for	c
the	c
young	c
people	c
who	c
want	c
get	c
money	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
meantime	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
study	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
work	c
in	c
a	c
fast	c
-	c
food	c
you	c
can	c
work	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
or	c
during	c
the	c
night	c
and	c
so	c
you	c
have	c
time	c
for	c
yourself	c

In	c
the	c
staff	c
you	c
can	c
also	c
find	c
young	c
people	c
and	c
getting	c
fun	c
with	c
them	c
during	c
the	c
work	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
want	c
more	c
?	c

If	c
you	c
need	c
money	c
and	c
you	c
need	c
time	c
for	c
yourself	c
try	c
a	c
job	c
like	c
that	c

You	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
really	c
good	c
,	i
freind	c
,	c
Pat	c
who	c
I	c
was	c
trusted	c
and	c
counted	c
on	c

I	c
have	c
know	c
her	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
.	c

and	c
we	c
were	c
love	c
each	c
other	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
falling	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
closest	i
freind	c

I	c
went	c
out	c
with	c
him	c
sometimes	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
happy	c
.	c

My	c
boy	c
freind	i
was	c
very	c
handsome	c
,	c
clever	c
and	c
very	c
polite	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
stedy	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
class	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
he	c
also	c
knowed	i
Pat	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
keep	c
serets	c
because	c
I	c
afraid	c
that	c
we	c
might	c
have	c
splited	c
up	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
relly	i
love	c
me	c
.	c

My	c
boy	c
freind	i
told	c
me	c
that	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
surprise	c
his	c
freind	i
in	c
his	c
class	c
when	c
the	c
times	c
comes	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
share	c
this	c
felling	c
to	c
someone	c
else	c
but	c
I	c
needed	c
to	c
keep	c
very	c
secret	c

I	c
felt	c
unhappy	c
sometimes	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
tell	c
my	c
best	c
freind	i
-	c
Pat	c
who	c
I	c
realio	c
-	c
on	c
her	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
everything	c
abat	c
my	c
boyfreind	c
and	c
when	c
we	c
were	c
met	c
each	c
other	c
and	c
evertauly	c
we	c
were	c
falling	c
in	c
love	c
.	c

After	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
I	c
felt	c
my	c
feeling	c
had	c
been	c
released	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
happy	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
told	c
her	c
to	c
keep	c
very	c
secret	c
did	c
n't	c
tell	c
anyone	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

On	c
Monday	c
morning	c
,	c
I	c
walked	c
into	c
the	c
class	c
and	c
all	c
of	c
my	i
freind	c
was	c
shouting	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
called	c
my	c
name	c
and	c
my	c
boyfreind	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
absolutely	c
ambaressed	c
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
ran	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
very	c
angry	c
to	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
should	c
n't	c
have	c
told	c
her	c
about	c
my	c
boy	c
friend	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
regret	c
but	c
too	c
late	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
secret	c
any	c
more	c
now	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
recived	i
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
wich	i
two	i
weeks	c
but	c
it	c
has	c
to	c
be	c
that	c
month	c
because	c
in	c
June	c
I	c
still	c
in	c
school	c
and	c
in	c
August	c
I'am	i
going	c
on	c
holiday	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
different	c
from	c
where	c
I	c
sleep	c
every	c
night	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
apreciate	c
it	i
if	c
there	c
are	c
still	c
tents	c
available	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
Climbing	c
,	c
I	c
haven't	c
done	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
always	c
found	c
it	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
to	c
become	c
better	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
activity	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
is	c
tennis	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
practising	c
for	c
four	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
and	c
also	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
attentions	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Hello	c
girl	c
how	c
are	c
you	c
doing	c
this	c
days	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
great	c
especially	c
last	c
weekend	c
in	c
the	c
concert	c
of	c
Backstreet	c
Boys	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
exciting	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
giving	c
two	c
concerts	c
one	c
in	c
Friday	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
one	c
in	c
Saturday	c
they	c
invited	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
friday	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
what	c
happened	c
:	c
when	c
I	c
arrive	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
in	c
backstage	c
with	c
the	c
scenery	c
,	c
then	c
the	c
group	c
arrived	c
,	c
we	c
chat	c
for	c
like	c
15	c
minutes	c
then	c
they	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
stage	c

Here	c
is	c
where	c
the	c
good	c
part	c
starts	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
doing	c
the	c
courtines	c
(	c
opening	c
and	c
closing	c
)	c
when	c
Nick	c
came	c
to	c
me	c
and	c
ask	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
stage	c
with	c
him	c
,	c
my	c
heart	c
started	c
beating	c

The	c
next	c
second	c
I	c
was	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
/	c
Madam	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
manager	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
product	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
back	c
my	c
money	c
because	c
that	c
was	c
not	c
same	c
as	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
planning	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
when	c
I	c
found	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
you	c
mentioned	c
actors	c
,	c
time	c
,	c
price	c
discount	c

DANNY	c
BROOK	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
actor	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
ticket	c
even	c
if	c
I	c
cancel	c
my	c
apointment	c
on	c
that	c
day	c
at	c
18=30	c
and	c
aslo	c
notice	c
of	c
price	c
discount	c
impressed	c
me	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
anything	c
not	c
only	c
discount	c
but	c
also	c
apporogize	c
us	c
for	c
dalay	c
of	c
starting	c
musical	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
different	c
actor	c
appeared	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
dinner	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
because	c
the	c
restrant	c
had	c
been	c
closed	c
.	c

It	c
made	c
me	c
so	c
dissapoint	i
and	c
angry	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
back	c
my	c
money	c
immedeastry	c
because	c
that	c
night	c
was	c
far	c
from	c
parfect	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

He	c
always	c
tried	c
to	c
say	c
nothing	c
and	c
did	c
.	c

But	c
everyone	c
always	c
noticed	c
he	c
had	c
secrets	c
from	c
his	c
face	c
.	c

Whenever	c
he	c
has	c
secrets	c
,	c
his	c
nose	c
moves	c
quickly	c

He	c
had	c
not	c
liked	c
this	c
habit	c
and	c
had	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
wrost	c
of	c
him	c
until	c
he	c
solved	c
a	c
big	c
crime	c
.	c

When	c
all	c
money	c
had	c
gone	i
from	i
a	c
bank	c
,	c
nobady	c
there	c
except	c
Pat	c
.	c

Bank	c
robbers	c
said	c
him	c
if	c
Pat	c
told	c
the	c
fact	c
somebody	c
they	c
killed	c
him	c
.	c

So	c
.	c

Pat	c
did	c
n't	c
say	c
anything	c
.	c

But	c
his	c
nose	c
moved	c
quickly	c
when	c
police	c
showed	c
a	c
picture	c
of	c
bank	c
robbers	c
.	c

Then	c
police	c
realized	c
who	c
were	c
bank	c
robbers	c
and	c
arested	c
them	c
.	c

Although	c
bank	c
robbers	c
complained	c
to	c
Pat	c
,	c
he	c
said	c
nothing	c
to	c
anybody	c
.	c

He	c
just	c
moved	c
his	c
nose	c
!	c

Thanks	c
to	c
his	c
habit	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
still	c
alive	c
and	c
all	c
money	c
were	c
backed	c
to	c
the	c
bank	c
.	c

The	c
town	c
became	c
peace	c
again	c

it	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
concert	c
I	c
've	c
ever	c
been	c
to	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
coolest	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
,	c
well	c
do	c
you	c
remember	c
my	c

Luke	c
,	c
the	c
one	c
that	c
works	c
as	c
a	c
security	c
guard	c
,	c
well	c
he	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
they	c
needed	c
people	c
to	c
put	c
everything	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
so	c
I	i
went	i
to	i
help	i
them	c
and	c
everithing	i
else	c
,	i
and	i
when	i

just	c
imagine	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
moby	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
say	c
hello	c
to	c
him	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
told	c
me	c
would	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
hand	c
with	c
my	c
decks	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
we	c
finished	c
he	c
gave	c
me	c
a	c
T	c
-	c

very	c
exciting	c
moment	c
and	c
very	c
nice	c
competition	c
.	c

And	c
now	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
first	c
winner	c
.	c

Is	c
wonderful	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
opportunitie	i
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c

In	c
answer	c
at	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
for	c
two	c
reason	c
one	c
's	c
is	c
because	c
I	c
totaly	i
will	c
finish	c
my	c
exam	c
in	c
that	c
date	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
in	c
the	c
first	c
two	c
week	c
I	c
will	c
go	c
to	c
Farnborought	c
is	c
special	c
10	c
days	c
the	c
presentation	c
the	c
Air	c
show	c
and	c
will	c
be	c
there	c
the	c
delegation	c
from	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

And	c
for	c
the	c
second	c
question	c
.	c

About	c
accommodation	c
during	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
;	c
because	c
maybe	c
is	c
more	c
interesting	c
to	c
share	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

In	c
other	c
hand	c
you	c
ask	c
me	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
for	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c
but	c
is	c
no	c
easy	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
anyway	c
I	c
like	c
more	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
possibilities	c
for	c
practice	i
climbing	i
and	i
surfing	c
.	c

Meanwhile	c
,	c
these	c
activities	c
are	c
develop	c

Can	c
you	c
said	c
me	c
if	c
is	c
necessary	c
to	c
bring	c
special	c
clothes	c
,	c
I	c
refer	c
for	c
instance	c
if	c
I	c
practice	c
surfing	c
I	c
need	c
water	c
suit	c
.	c

Is	c
possible	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
?	c

At	c
the	c
same	c
situation	c
for	c
climbing	c
I	c
need	c
special	c
equipment	c
and	c
then	c
there	c
are	c
available	c
in	c
the	c
Camp	c
and	c
what	c
about	c
the	c
guide	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
topic	c
is	c
so	c
exciting	c
in	c
the	c
antropological	c
and	c
psicological	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
can	i
studie	c
the	c
reaction	c
before	c
,	c
during	c
and	c
after	c
to	c
shopping	c

People	c
in	c
general	c
have	c
a	c
compulsory	i
actitud	i
for	c
shopping	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
.	c

Because	c
sometimes	c
the	c
article	c
for	c
to	c
buy	c
is	c
not	c
really	c
necessary	c
.	c
We	c
must	c
to	c
accept	c
that	c
media	c
have	c
so	c
important	c
effect	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
in	c
special	c
the	c
T.V.	c

For	c
the	c
men	c
and	c
women	c
is	c
important	c
the	c
appearance	c
and	c
they	c
spent	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
in	c
buy	c
clothes	c
,	c
cosmetic	c
,	c
accesories	c
,	c
jewels	c
etc	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
other	c
they	c
choose	c
sometimes	c
just	c
for	c
the	c
label	c
.	c

Without	c
give	c
really	c
importance	c
to	c
the	c
calidad	c
in	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
appearance	c
there	c
is	c
more	c
preocupation	c
in	c
the	c
food	c
area	c
,	c
because	c
people	c
in	c
general	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
spent	c
the	c
time	c
for	c
prepare	c
food	c
and	c
when	c
they	c
shopping	c
they	c
choose	c
pre	c
-	c
prepared	c
food	c

We	c
know	c
is	c
more	c
easy	c
for	c
these	c
busy	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
the	c
facilities	c
for	c
access	c
to	c
mall	c
center	c
is	c
not	c
good	c
.	c

The	c
area	c
for	c
parking	c
,	c
space	c
for	c
play	c
grown	c
to	c
the	c
children	c
or	c
bus	c
station	c
near	c
the	c
mall	c
is	c
not	c
really	c
appropiate	c

Otherwise	c
shopping	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
in	c
the	c
nearly	c
future	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
decide	c
with	c
the	c
goverment	i
.	c

which	c
is	c
special	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
town	c
we	c
lefet	c
just	c
for	c
comerical	c
area	c
,	c
but	c
of	c
course	c
with	c
all	c
the	c
facilities	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
like	c
a	c
big	c
supermarket	c

DEAR	c
SIR	c
,	c

I	c
AM	c
WRITING	c
TO	c
COMPLAIN	c
ABOUT	c
A	c
MUSICAL	c
SHOW	c
THAT	c
IS	c
TAKING	c
PART	c
IN	c
THE	c
CIRCLE	c
THEATRE	c
.	c

I	c
WAS	c
WORRIED	c
WHEN	c
I	c
SAW	c
THE	c
ADVERTISEMENT	c
OF	c
THE	c
PLAY	c
IN	c
A	c
NEWSPAPER	c
ON	c
SUNDAY	c
.	c

THE	c
FIRST	c
PROBLEM	c
WAS	c
WHEN	c
I	c
READ	c
THE	c
STARRING	c
.	c

IT	c
SAID	c
:	c
'	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
'	c

BUT	c
,	c
WHEN	c
I	c
WAS	c
WATCHING	c
THE	c
PLAY	c
,	c
I	c
REALISED	c
THAT	c
THERE	c
WAS	c
A	c
DIFFERENT	c
ACTOR	c
AND	c
,	c
REALLY	c
,	c
I	c

ANOTHER	c
PROBLEM	c
WAS	c
THE	c
TIME	c
THAT	c
I	c
HAD	c
TO	c
WAIT	c
.	c

I	c
THOUGHT	c
IT	c
WILL	c
BE	c
AT	c
19.30	c
AND	c
I	c
HAVE	c
BEEN	c
WAITING	c
FOR	c
FORTY	c
FIVE	c
MINUTES	c
!	c
!	c
BESIDES	c
THIS	c
,	c
I	c
COULD	c
NOT	c
VISIT	c
THE	c
RESTAURANT	c
IN	c
THE	c
THEATRE	c
BECAUSE	c
IT	c
WAS	c
CLOSED	c

IN	c
ADITION	c
TO	c
THIS	c
,	c
I	c
DID	c
NOT	c
HAVE	c
ANY	c
DISCOUNT	c
IN	c
MY	c
TICKET	c

SO	c
,	c
I	c
HAD	c
TO	c
PAY	c
A	c
LOT	c
OF	c
MONEY	c
TO	c
SEE	c
A	c
PLAY	c
THAT	c
WAS	c
A	c
COMPLETELY	c
DISASTER	c

TO	c
SUM	c
UP	c
,	c
I	c
DID	c
NOT	c
SPEND	c
A	c
PERFECT	c
EVENING	c
.	c

I	c
THINK	c
THAT	c
IT	c
WAS	c
THE	c
WORST	c
I	c
HAVE	c
EVER	c
HAD	c
.	c

ON	c
THE	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
\"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
\"	c
,	c
that	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
on	c
the	c
16th	c
of	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
actor	i
suppossed	i
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
not	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
seen	c
before	c
,	c
so	i
,	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
imagen	c
,	c
I	c

Another	c
complain	c
is	c
about	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
started	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c

It	c
was	c
terrible	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
about	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
the	c
were	c
different	c
prices	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
discounts	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
many	c
people	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
the	c
show	c

Finally	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
a	c
bit	c
late	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
but	c
this	c
place	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
had	c
already	c

At	c
is	c
explain	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
that	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
have	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
that	c
I	c
mentioned	c
before	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Pat	c
,	c
Maria	c
's	c
best	c
friend	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
so	c
Maria	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
she	c
realised	c
that	c
Manuel	c
knew	c
the	c
truth	c
about	c
the	c
feelings	c
that	c
Maria	c
had	c
for	c
him	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
so	c
angry	c
she	c
almost	c
kill	c
but	c
,	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
because	c
Pat	c
was	c
her	c
best	c

Maria	c
talked	c
to	c
Pat	c
about	c
the	c
stupid	c
thing	c
that	c
she	c
did	c
,	c
but	c
Pat	c
refused	c
to	c
apologaising	c
to	c
her	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
felt	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
mistake	c
and	c
she	c
did	c
it	c
for	c
only	c
one	c
reason	c
:	c
help	c
Maria	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
man	c
that	c
she	c
loved	c
.	c

Maria	c
was	c
speechless	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
that	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
so	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
stop	c
talking	c
to	c
Pat	c

After	c
3	c
weeks	c
,	c
Maria	c
got	c
ill	c
so	c
she	c
was	c
not	c
available	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

Some	c
friends	c
phoned	c
her	c
everyday	i
,	c
except	c
Pat	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
friend	c
that	c
Maria	c
really	c
loved	c
,	c
despite	c
that	c
,	c
she	c
was	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
when	c
Maria	c
was	c
seating	c
in	c
her	c
bedroom	c
,	c
someone	c
knock	c
the	c
door	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
Manuel	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
worried	c

Maria	c
was	c
nervous	c
,	c
but	c
for	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
,	c
she	c
could	c
talk	c
to	c
him	c
as	c
she	c
never	c
did	c
before	c
,	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
the	c
happiest	c
person	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
she	c
gave	c
her	c
first	c
kiss	c
and	c
she	c
had	c
Pat	c
's	c
friendship	c
back	c
,	c
after	c
all	c
,	c
everything	c

Wawsaw	c

12th	c
December	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
organising	c
such	c
a	i
wonderfull	c
trip	c
with	c
an	c
interesting	c
program	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
all	c
extremely	c
excited	c
especially	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
the	c
town	c
we	c
were	c
always	c
interested	c
in	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
may	c
other	c
interesting	c
places	c
and	c
exhibitions	c
to	c
see	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
our	c
visit	c
there	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
\"	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
coinsidence	c
which	c
we	c
would	c
be	c
extremely	c
happy	c
to	c
take	c
advantage	c
on	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
famous	c
fashion	c
models	c
who	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
authograps	c
from	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
changing	c
the	c
excursion	i
program	i
a	c
little	c
will	c
not	c
cause	c
any	c
problems	c
.	c

Our	c
suggestion	c
is	c
to	c
visit	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
instead	c
of	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

Because	c
the	c
fashion	c
show	c
lasts	i
a	c
whole	c
day	c
long	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
ready	c
to	c
give	c
up	c
our	c
shopping	c
and	c
Free	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
starts	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
at	c
10.00	c
and	c
ends	c
at	c
19.00	c
the	c
same	c
day	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
sorry	c
for	c
any	c
inconvenience	c
caused	c
by	c
our	c
request	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Famous	c
people	c
are	c
living	c
creatures	c
.	c

They	c
breathe	c
,	c
eat	c
,	c
feel	c
and	c
beside	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
famous	c
they	c
are	c
just	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
anyone	c
else	c

Nobody	c
likes	c
to	c
be	c
observed	c
constantly	c
or	c
touched	c
by	c
strangers	c
and	c
pointed	c
out	c
in	c
the	c
streets	c
with	c
no	c
right	c
even	c
or	c
just	c
a	c
little	c
privacy	c
.	c

I	c
personally	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
would	c
be	c
to	c
put	c
the	c
celebrities	c
in	c
cages	c
and	c
let	c
people	c
touch	c
them	c
,	c
point	c
and	c
ask	c
for	c
authopraps	c
.	c

Like	c
in	c
the	c
zoo	c
.	c

The	c
biggest	c
commercial	c
gain	c
in	c
history	c
I	c
believe	c
,	c
but	c
celebrities	c
are	c
not	c
animals	c
although	c
they	c
may	c
be	c
sometimes	c
treated	c
the	c
same	c
way	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
they	c
must	c
have	c
done	c
something	c
to	c
become	c
famous	c

It	c
may	c
in	c
many	c
cases	c
,	c
not	c
be	c
true	c
but	c
we	c
can	c
suspect	c
that	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
wanted	c
to	c
become	c
a	c
celebrity	c
and	c
they	c
had	c
to	c
know	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
private	c
life	c
unseparately	c
contected	c
to	c
it	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
everyone	c
has	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
keep	c
privacy	c
of	c
their	c
own	c
homes	c
and	c
even	c
someone	c
extremely	c
famous	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
their	c
private	c
life	c
is	c
interesting	c
for	c
ordinary	c
people	c
and	c
it	c
brings	c
commercial	c
gain	i
to	c
publishers	c
,	c
journalists	c
and	c
photographers	c
,	c
famous	c
people	c
will	c
just	c
have	c
to	c
get	c
use	c
to	c
this	c
living	c
\"	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

The	c
purpose	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
is	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
on	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Fesival	c
I	c
attended	c
last	c
weekend	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
event	c
was	c
good	c
,	c
however	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
the	c
festival	c
can	c
be	c
improved	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
organizing	c
an	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
fantastic	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
it	c
was	c
said	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
find	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
arround	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
when	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
from	c
only	c

I	c
do	c
understand	c
that	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
difficult	c
to	c
get	c
these	c
people	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
festival	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
if	c
next	c
year	c
we	c
could	c
meet	c
other	c
personalities	c

Secondly	c
I	c
belive	i
you	c
should	c
know	c
that	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
including	c
me	c
,	c
were	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
enjoy	c
concerts	c
because	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
thankful	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
was	c
excellent	c
because	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
it	c
was	c
cheaper	c
than	c
paying	c
for	c
each	c
event	c
separatelly	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
find	c
my	c
opinion	c
useful	c
.	c

Once	c
again	c
congratulations	c
on	c
the	c
Festival	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

yours	c
sincerelly	i

tips	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c

When	c
the	c
holidays	c
began	c
everybody	c
is	c
happy	c
because	c
it	c
represents	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
a	c
time	c
full	c
of	c
fun	c
and	c
lots	c
of	c
interesting	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
do	c
these	c
things	c
we	c
all	c
need	c
money	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
to	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

there	c
are	c
several	c
ways	c
to	c
earn	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
money	c
in	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
common	c
examples	c
is	c
baby-	c
sitting	c
taking	c
care	c
of	c
little	c
children	c
is	c
easy	c
and	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
require	c
special	c
skills	c
,	c
all	c
you	c
need	c
is	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
patience	c
.	c

If	c
looking	c
after	c
children	c
does	c
n't	c
fit	c
you	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
try	c
with	c
pets	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
people	c
would	c
pay	c
you	c
to	c
take	c
their	c
dog	c
for	c
a	c
walk	c
.	c

So	c
if	c
you	c
like	c
animals	c
this	c
is	c
your	c
chance	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
and	c
have	c
fun	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

Another	c
option	c
is	c
to	c
wash	c
your	c
neighbour	c
's	c
car	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
materials	c
you	c
will	c
work	c
with	c
,	c
but	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
,	c
soap	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
expensive	c
.	c

the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
wisely	c
choose	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
work	c
for	c
you	c
,	c
according	i
to	c
the	c
things	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
find	c
anything	c
good	c
enough	c
for	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
always	c
remember	c
:	c
It	c
's	c
not	c
all	c
about	c
the	c
money	c

To	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
that	c
you	c
provided	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
the	c
whole	c
class	c
would	c
enjoy	c

However	c
,	c
our	c
class	c
has	c
spotted	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
would	c
all	c
wish	c
to	c
attend	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
March	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
from	c
10.00	c
till	c
7.00pm	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
will	c
be	c
about	c
all	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	c
up	c
and	c
hairstyles	c

We	c
would	c
also	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
financially	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

This	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
people	c
of	c
London	c
and	c
their	c
fashions	c
and	c
style	c
we	c
might	c
also	c
get	c
a	c
change	c
to	c
meet	c
new	c
people	c
and	c
interest	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

The	c
whole	c
class	c
is	c
also	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
this	c
fashion	c
show	c
and	c
would	c
really	c
appreciate	c
your	c
giving	c
them	c
a	c
change	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
few	c
suggestion	c
on	c
how	c
the	c
programme	c
could	c
be	c
changed	c
to	c
fit	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
in	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
do	c
as	c
planned	c
for	c
Monday	c
and	c
move	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
from	c
Tuesday	c
to	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
forgo	c
the	c
shopping	c
as	c
we	c
might	c
not	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
and	c
the	c
exchange	c
rate	c
might	c
be	c
too	c
high	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
do	c
much	c
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
however	c
go	c
and	c
look	c
around	c
the	c
shopping	c
mall	c
if	c
we	c
have	c
time	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
us	c
your	c
permission	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
would	c
consider	c
this	c
matter	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Everyday	i
,	c
something	c
changes	c
and	c
we	c
become	c
more	c
modern	c
companies	c
use	c
computers	c
instead	c
of	c
books	c
,	c
dentist	c
use	c
modernized	c
electrical	c
item	c
instead	c
of	c
just	c
a	c
plier	c
,	c
even	c
homes	c
are	c
effected	c

From	c
letters	c
to	c
emails	c
,	c
from	c
gas	c
stoves	c
to	c
electric	i
stoves	c
and	c
microwaves	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
are	c
n't	c
just	c
going	c
to	c
stop	c
here	c
are	c
we	c

No	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
the	c
present	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
past	c
and	c
these	c
things	c
now	c
new	c
to	c
use	c
will	c
be	c
old	c
,	c
outdated	c
and	c

I	c
see	c
a	c
very	c
different	c
home	c
for	c
us	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Most	c
things	c
will	c
be	c
computerised	c
.	c

We	c
might	c
even	c
be	c
using	c
voice	c
identification	c
and	c
fingerprints	c
instead	c
of	c
keys	c
.	c

We	c
an	c
on	c
and	c
off	c
lights	c
with	c
touch	c
pads	c
and	c
remote	c
controllers	c
.	c

We	c
might	c
even	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
open	c
the	c
door	c
without	c
getting	c
out	c
from	c
the	c
living	c
room	c
.	c

Cameras	c
will	c
be	c
something	c
usual	c
in	c
every	c
house	c
instead	c
of	c
that	c
little	c
peephole	c
in	c
your	c
door	c
.	c

Although	c
all	c
that	c
may	c
change	c
our	c
houses	c
may	c
be	c
still	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

The	c
rooms	c
and	c
size	c
should	c
remain	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
and	c
the	c
living	c
rooms	c
and	c
all	c
may	c
still	c
be	c
decorated	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
style	c
.	c

We	c
might	c
still	c
favour	c
that	c
old	c
carpet	c
and	c
couch	c

The	c
furniture	c
should	c
not	c
change	c
that	c
much	c
on	c
the	c
outside	c
and	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
rooms	c
should	c
not	c
change	c
too	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
every	c
child	c
might	c
have	c
a	c
laptop	c

And	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
why	c
not	c
let	c
school	c
come	c
to	c
you	c
?	c
We	c
will	c
be	c
learning	c
at	c
home	c
using	c
computers	c
and	c
disc	c

Never	c
have	c
to	c
leave	c
the	c
house	c
or	c
wake	c
up	c
so	c
early	c
.	c

Another	c
way	c
our	c
home	c
could	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
is	c
probably	c
the	c
utilitles	c
we	c
are	c
using	c
.	c

We	c
might	c
not	c
need	c
maids	c
to	c
do	c
housework	c
anymore	c
as	c
they	c
can	c
easily	c
be	c
replaced	c
with	c
a	c
robot	c
,	c
a	c
machine	c
,	c
or	c
something	c
other	c
with	c
the	c
same	c
purpose	c
.	c

Our	c
homes	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
in	c
terms	c
of	c
the	c
kitchen	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
filled	c
with	c
vegetables	c
and	c
meat	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
people	c
wo	c
n't	c
miss	c
the	c
great	c
taste	c
of	c
food	c
although	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
subsituted	c
to	c
a	c
vitamin	c
pill	c
or	c
two	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
all	c
this	c
changes	c
wo	c
n't	c
really	c
be	c
noticed	c
as	c
we	c
change	c
it	c
daily	c
and	c
slowly	c
instead	c
abruptedly	c
.	c

People	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
adjust	c
and	c
change	c
with	c
the	c
times	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

On	c
behalf	c
of	c
our	c
class	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
,	c
that	c
we	c
saw	c
advertised	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
interested	c
indeed	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
details	c
about	c
this	c
show	c

It	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
and	c
the	c
suitable	c
time	c
will	c
be	c
10.00	c
-	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
that	c
this	c
day	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
after	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
for	c
shopping	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
believe	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
change	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
to	c
attend	c
this	c
show	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
!	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
starts	c
is	c
perfect	c
and	c
is	c
suitable	c
as	c
well	c
with	c
our	c
programme	c
because	c
until	c
19:00	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
everyone	c
will	c
have	c
finished	c
their	c
shopping	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
details	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
particularly	c
what	c
does	c
it	c
include	c
.	c

The	c
latest	c
fashion	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
show	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
Leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	c
Really	c
interesting	c
!	c

Moreover	c
all	c
about	c
the	c
make	c
up	c
and	c
the	c
hairstyles	c
.	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
to	c
be	c
on	c
this	c
show	c
while	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
problem	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
the	c
same	c
hour	c
with	c
shopping	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
having	c
the	c
shopping	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
anything	c
to	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c
,	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Some	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
famous	c
person	c
is	c
very	c
excuiting	c
thing	c
,	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
this	c
makes	c
you	c
feel	c
completely	c
and	c
also	c
they	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
famous	c
you	c
are	c
special	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
,	c
that	c
if	c
somebody	c
wants	c
the	c
fame	c
and	c
the	c
glory	c
must	c
be	c
tottally	c
sure	c
about	c
the	c
results	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	c
politicians	c
the	c
have	c
choosed	i
their	i
careers	c
,	c
they	c
must	c
know	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
involved	c
with	c
everything	c
that	c
it	c
has	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
publicity	c
and	c
their	c
country	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
is	c
that	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
realize	c
that	c
they	c
should	c
be	c
extremely	c
careful	c
of	c
their	c
movements	c
or	c
else	c
they	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
bad	c
reputation	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
not	c
trustworthy	c

Another	c
succesfull	c
carreer	c
such	c
as	c
,	c
film	c
stars	c
must	c
also	c
be	c
balanced	c

If	c
somebody	c
is	c
a	c
film	c
star	c
this	c
mean	c
that	c
has	c
got	c
a	c
different	c
kind	c
of	c
life	c
,	c
more	c
comfortable	c
,	c
more	c
interesting	c
but	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
mean	c
that	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	c
like	c
normal	c
people	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
is	c
a	c
star	c
.	c

If	c
somebody	c
wants	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
of	c
cource	c
must	c
be	c
on	c
the	c
top	c
and	c
the	c
mass	c
media	c
will	c
be	c
following	c
him	c
or	c
her	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
are	c
limits	c
.	c

Everybody	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
is	c
a	c
plumber	c
or	c
even	c
if	c
she	c
is	c
a	c
famous	c
singer	c
.	c

It	c
does	c
n't	c
matter	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
carreer	c
or	i
job	i
you	c
are	c
follow	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
control	c
your	c
behaviour	c
and	c
try	c
not	c
implove	c
so	c
much	c
yourself	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
the	c
journalists	c
the	c
should	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
respect	c
the	c
private	c
life	c
of	c
everyone	c
and	c
not	c
trying	c
to	c
make	c
money	c
for	c
a	c
living	c
by	c
using	c
the	c
reputation	c
of	c
the	c
famous	c
people	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
the	c
great	c
opportunity	c
you	c
give	c
us	c
,	c
especially	i
in	i
planing	i
all	c
this	c
programme	c
in	c
a	c
such	c
acurate	c
way	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
programme	c
has	c
a	c
good	c
organisation	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
we	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
visit	c
plenty	c
of	c
local	i
interest	c

But	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
,	c
like	c
a	c
student	c
of	c
this	c
college	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
would	c
change	c
part	c
of	c
this	c
programme	c
...	c
we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c

It	c
takes	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
and	c
begins	c
at	c
ten	c
o'clock	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
way	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
earlier	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
the	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c

Front	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
like	c
the	c
leisure	c
,	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	c
up	c
,	c
hairstyles	c
,	c
you	c
know	c
...	c
I	c
strongly	c
believe	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
at	c
the	c
right	c
time	c
and	c
best	c
city	c
to	c

Please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
agree	c
with	c
us	c
!	c

Oh	c
I	c
forgot	c
about	c
it	c
!	c

Besides	c
,	c
this	c
show	c
is	c
gree	c
(	c
another	c
positiu	c
point	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c

FANCY	c
GETTING	c
TO	c
KNOW	c
THE	c
FUTURE	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
've	c
the	c
future	c
in	c
your	c
hands	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
we	c
're	c
living	c
like	c
old	c
times	c
?	c

Would	c
you	c
like	c
living	c
in	c
a	c
modern	c
way	c
?	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
expect	c
about	c
the	c
future	c
?	c

Can	c
you	c
compare	c
it	c

Are	c
you	c
afraid	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
look	c
at	c
your	c
house	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
all	c
kind	c
of	c
instruments	c
to	c
washing	c
up	c
the	c
dishes	c
,	c
to	c
cook	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
comfortable	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
the	c
TV	c
,	c
the	c
video	c
recorder	c
,	c
etc	c

Maybe	c
,	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
years	c
later	c
we	c
'll	c
have	c
a	c
bigger	c
TV	c
,	c
a	c
more	c
suitable	c
radio	c
but	c
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
these	c
facts	c
will	c
not	c
change	c
the	i
way	c
of	c
our	c
lifes	c
.	c
We	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
accelerate	c
the	c
process	c
of	c
the	c
computer	c
's	c
games	c
for	c

But	c
not	c
in	c
the	c
strange	c
way	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
...	c

I	c
mean	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
we	c
'll	c
change	c
cars	c
by	c
aereoplanes	c
...	c

In	c
this	c
way	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
calm	c
because	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
the	c
things	c
are	c
developing	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
way	c
you'r	c
changing	c
,	c
too	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
strongly	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
the	c
house	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
house	c
of	c
a	c
new	c
mindness	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
very	c
positiu	c
point	c
for	c
opening	c
our	i
lifes	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
the	c
future	c
in	c
our	c
hands	c

Think	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Principal	c
,	c
First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
good	c
programme	c
which	c
provides	c
us	c
3	c
days	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

It	c
contains	i
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
activities	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
sightseeing	c
,	c
river	c
trip	c
,	c
visiting	c
science	c
museum	c
and	c
gallery	c

It	c
is	c
certain	c
that	c
the	c
programme	c
will	c
give	c
the	c
students	c
considerable	c
enjoyment	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
found	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
at	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c

The	c
advertisement	c
says	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
full	c
of	c
many	c
interesting	c
programmes	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	c
up	c
and	c
hairstyles	c
etc	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
students	c
are	c
allowed	c
to	c
admit	c
for	c
free	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
attend	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
young	c
people	c
,	c
particularly	c
girls	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
and	c
make	c
up	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
are	c
expecting	c
the	c
show	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
what	c
the	c
new	c
trend	c
in	c
fashion	c
will	c
be	c
like	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
give	c
a	c
little	c
change	c
in	c
programme	c
so	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
attend	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
good	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
of	c
14th	c
into	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
the	c
science	c
museum	c
and	c
shopping	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Technical	c
and	c
Warm	c
Home	c
People	c
's	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
has	c
considerably	i
been	c
changed	c
by	c
rapdily	c
developing	c
mordern	i
technology	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
good	c
to	c
look	c
back	c
on	c
how	c
our	c
parents	c
have	c
lived	c
in	c
a	c
house	c
.	c

50	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
Korean	c
mothers	c
should	c
have	c
made	c
a	c
fire	c
by	c
burning	c
woods	c
to	c
warm	c
a	c
room	c
up	c
and	c
make	c
food	c
.	c

Since	c
the	c
eletric	c
fire	c
and	c
microwave	c
oven	c
had	c
been	c
invented	c
,	c
their	c
life	c
have	c
been	c
far	c
easier	c
than	c
before	c

Today	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
to	c
spend	c
many	c
times	c
on	c
making	c
food	c
,	c
washing	c
up	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
on	c
turning	c
on	c
an	c
off	c
the	c
light	c

Machines	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
a	c
dish	c
washer	c
,	c
laundry	c
machine	c
and	c
remote	c
controller	c
help	c
us	c
jut	c
to	c
relax	c
or	c
do	c
a	c
little	c
work	c
necessary	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
people	c
's	c
home	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
controlled	c
by	c
a	c
computer	c
which	c
is	c
devised	c
in	c
every	i
machine	c
,	c
TV	c
,	c
cooker	c
and	c
the	c
light	c
,	c
connecting	c
to	c

He	c
/	c
she	c
can	c
just	c
press	c
the	c
button	c
or	c
send	c
e	c
-	c
mail	c
to	c
operate	c
what	c
he	c
/	c
she	c
needs	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
the	c
owner	c
is	c
far	c
from	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
people	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
living	c
in	c
a	c
building	c
which	c
is	c
constructed	c
for	c
a	c
\"	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
computer	c
,	c
children	c
will	c
need	c
food	c
their	c
mothers	c
make	c
and	c
love	c
expressed	c
not	c
by	c
a	c
computer	c
,	c
but	c
by	c
parents	c
themselves	c
.	c

Computer	c
might	c
know	c
better	c
than	c
human	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
things	c
which	c
it	c
can	c
not	c
replace	c
in	c
our	c
life	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
enthusiatic	c
about	c
receiving	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c
I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
necessary	c
information	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
during	c
that	c
period	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
free	c
from	c
work	c
,	c
my	c
current	c
post	c
finishes	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
but	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
another	c
job	c
at	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
rather	c
than	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
something	c
different	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
the	c
activities	c
are	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
to	c
do	c
Tennis	c
and	c
Swimming	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
playing	c
Tennis	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
learning	c
to	c
swim	c
for	c
three	c
months	c
so	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
a	c
useful	c
training	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Moreover	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
for	c
living	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
a	c
large	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
this	c
prize	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
need	c
further	c
information	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

In	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
concert	c
...	c
oh	c
it	c
was	c
fantastic	c
!	c

I	c
've	c
always	c
loved	c
music	c
so	c
working	c
in	c
a	c
concert	c
was	c
great	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
many	c
people	c
are	c
involved	c
in	c
the	c
organization	c
of	c
a	c
concert	c
,	c
apart	c
from	c
the	c
musicists	c
and	c
the	c
singers	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
people	c
who	c
work	c
with	c
lights	c
,	c
who	c
organize	c
the	c
security	c
service	c
...	c
it	c
was	c
so	c

My	c
work	c
consisted	c
in	c
checking	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
the	c
number	c
on	c
them	c
and	c
taking	c
the	c
people	c
to	c
their	c
seats	c

It	c
was	c
also	c
very	c
tiring	c
because	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
and	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
my	c
help	c
;	c
so	c
they	c
went	c
around	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
looking	c
for	c
their	c
seats	c
and	c
making	c
so	c
much	c
noise	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
people	c
never	c
grow	c
up	c
,	c
if	c
they	c
had	c
been	c
a	c
class	c
of	c
children	c
,	c
they	c
would	c
have	c
made	c
less	c

Anyway	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
these	c
little	c
problems	c

Now	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
,	c
write	c
soon	c
and	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
:	c

I	c
've	c
recived	i
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
pleased	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
because	c
I	c
needed	c
some	c
days	c
to	c
relax	c
myself	c
and	c
to	c
leave	c
the	c
city	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
extressing	c

I	c
only	c
can	c
travel	c
on	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
working	c
in	c
an	c
office	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
ask	c
my	c
boss	c
for	c
a	c
holiday	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
mounth	c
he	i
can	c
give	c
me	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
hope	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
a	c
problem	c
for	c
you	c
.	c

To	c
spend	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	c
in	c
tents	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
a	c
way	c
to	c
be	c
nearer	c
the	c
enviroment	i
and	c
the	c
animals	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
living	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
liking	c
all	c
the	c
sports	c
you	c
wrote	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
I	c
am	c
only	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
and	c
sailing	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
practise	c
them	c
with	c
my	c
father	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
doubt	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
important	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
money	c
or	c
all	c
is	i
payed	i
,	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
wear	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
good	c
or	c
bad	c
...	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
extra	c
information	c
you	c
can	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c

Why	c
people	c
like	c
so	c
much	c
go	c
shopping	c
?	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
that	c
go	c
shopping	c
are	c
women	c
who	c
must	c
buy	c
food	c
and	c
other	c
kind	c
of	c
things	c
for	c
her	c
family	c
,	c
so	c
for	c
them	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
boring	c
activity	c
that	c
is	c
repeated	c
everyday	c
and	c
that	c
drive	c
them	c
crazy	c
when	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
best	c
product	c
and	c
the	c
cheapest	c
price	c
to	c
save	c
some	c
money	c
.	c

Othrewise	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
people	c
who	c
think	c
the	c
opposite	c
;	c
such	c
as	c
:	c
children	c
,	c
teenagers	c
,	c
men	c
;	c
but	c
not	c
always	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
go	c
to	c
buy	c
hardly	c
ever	c
,	c
only	c
when	c
they	c
need	c
clothes	c
or	c

In	c
that	c
way	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
as	c
funny	c
as	c
you	c
want	c
,	c
although	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
it	c
very	c
often	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
as	c
an	c
obligation	c
in	c
the	c
future	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
all	c
you	c
make	c
in	c
small	c
cuantities	c
is	c
good	c
and	c
funny	c
,	c
but	c
do	c
n't	c
encrease	c
them	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
feel	c
uncomfortable	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
a	c
two	c
weeks	c
holiday	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
finish	c
my	c
exams	c
in	c
June	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
planning	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
China	c
in	c
early	c
August	c

So	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
and	c
coming	c
back	c
before	c
6th	c
of	c
August	c
,	c
that	c
would	c
be	c
great	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
living	c
in	c
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
had	c
any	c
experience	c
to	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
it	c
a	c
go	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
enjoy	c
myself	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
swimming	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
any	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c

I	c
really	c
wanted	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
swim	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
coach	c
could	c
give	c
us	c
a	c
lesson	c
during	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
join	c
basketball	c
team	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
,	c
and	c
our	c
high	c
school	c
basketball	c
team	c
have	c
won	c
many	c
competitions	c
during	c
last	c
ten	c
years	c
in	c
our	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
I	c
had	c
taken	c
a	c
part	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
competitions	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
proud	c
of	c
our	c
basketball	c
team	c

Would	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
that	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
you	c
would	c
give	c
it	c
to	c
me	c
and	c
how	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
in	c
U.S.A.	c
Thank	c
you	c
for	c
every	c
thing	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
,	c
haven't	c
seen	c
you	c
since	c
last	c
summer	c
holiday	c
,	c
hope	c
everything	c
is	c
fine	c
in	c
your	c
place	c

You	c
wanted	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
which	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
last	c
month	c
?	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
fun	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
had	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
experience	c
before	c

Before	c
the	c
concert	c
actually	c
started	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
give	c
out	c
lots	c
of	c
leaflets	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
list	c
of	c
pop	c
band	c
and	c
group	c
which	c
will	c
appear	c
in	c
the	c
concert	c
in	c
order	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
their	c
performance	c
and	c
backgrounds	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
people	c
who	c
had	c
a	c
ticket	c
but	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
their	c
seat	c

During	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
chance	c
to	c
see	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
performance	c
,	c
that	c

I	c
was	c
excited	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
closer	c
look	c
at	c
so	c
many	c
famous	c
pop	c
stars	c
.	c

During	c
break	c
time	c
I	c
did	c
give	c
a	c
lots	c
of	c
direction	c
to	i
people	c
who	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
toilet	c
,	c
and	c
information	c
such	c
as	c
where	c
they	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
cup	c
of	c
coffee	c

That	c
was	c
bit	c
boring	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
part	c
of	c
my	c
job	c

I	c
got	c
to	c
go	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
about	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
Competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
to	c
California	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
summer	c
holidays	c
in	c
that	c
month	c

About	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
in	c
my	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
bed	c

Also	c
tents	c
are	c
not	c
fairly	c
comfortable	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
camp	c
activities	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c
windsurfing	c
for	c
5	c
years	c
,	c
for	c
that	c
reason	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
fairly	c
interested	c
in	c
sailing	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
keen	c
on	c
painting	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
painted	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
in	c
California	c
?	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
advice	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
for	c
the	c
trip	c
?	c
and	c
is	c
there	c
anything	c
else	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
know	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Hello	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
've	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
two	c
days	c
ago	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
quite	c
happy	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
passed	c
F.C.E.	c
I	i
'm	c
ok	c
and	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
last	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
Madrid	c
last	c
week	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
walking	c
in	c
the	c
street	c
when	c
somebody	c
asked	c
me	c
an	c
address	c
.	c

I	c
looked	c
at	c
him	c
and	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
this	c
person	c
was	c
David	c
Bowie	c
.	c

Yes	c
!	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
trying	c
to	c
speak	c
in	c
Spanish	c
,	c
but	c
his	c
accent	c
was	c
terrible	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
speak	c
in	c
English	c
with	c
him	c

I	c
explained	c
to	c
him	c
where	c
was	c
the	c
street	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
and	c
we	c
carried	c
out	c
with	c
the	c
conversation	c
for	c
a	c
while	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
rude	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
wrong	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
n't	c
arrogant	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
he	c
looks	c
very	c

I	c
liked	c
my	c
experience	c
with	c
him	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
was	c
when	c
he	c
gave	c
me	c
his	c
e	c
-	c
mail	c
address	c
.	c

Yeah	c
!	c


I	c
'm	c
not	c
joking	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
his	c
e	c
-	c
mail	c

Well	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
got	c
an	c
appoinment	c
with	c
the	c
Dentist	c

Write	c
me	c
soon	c
and	c
take	c
care	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
learnt	c
from	c
you	c
letter	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
how	c
luck	c
I	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
understood	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
when	c
am	c
I	c
available	c
to	c
set	c
off	c
and	c
where	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
U.S.A	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
university	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
studying	c
Economics	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
busy	c
nowadays	c
.	c

My	c
exams	c
will	c
have	c
finished	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
only	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
set	c
off	c
in	c
July	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
will	c
give	c
my	c
thesis	c
to	c
my	c
teacher	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

This	c
holiday	c
will	c
help	c
me	c
to	c
think	c
and	c
prepare	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
need	c
a	c
proper	c
place	c
to	c
say	c
and	c
study	c
.	c

Basically	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
small	c
tent	c

When	c
I	c
get	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
climb	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
climb	c
mountains	c
and	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
fond	c
of	c
swimming	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
swimmer	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
some	c
questions	c
which	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
.	c

Is	c
there	c
any	c
toilet	c
and	c
shower	c
in	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
or	c
somewhere	c
nearby	c
?	c

Do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
any	c
special	c
clothes	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
idea	c
what	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
mone	c
do	c
you	c
recommend	c
me	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Is	c
the	c
camp	c
close	c
to	c
town	c
or	c
city	c
?	c

Will	c
you	c
provide	c
me	c
an	c
instructor	i
when	c
I	c
climb	c
and	c
swim	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
haven't	c
written	c
you	c
for	c
ages	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
apologise	c
for	c
this	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

How	c
is	c
your	c
new	c
school	c
and	c
parents	c
?	c
I	c
hope	c
we	c
can	c
catch	c
up	c
with	c
each	c
other	c
's	c
news	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
the	c
service	c
crew	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
unbelievable	c
and	c
tiring	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
all	c
the	c
pop	c
bands	c
and	c
singers	c
.	c

I	c
heard	c
them	c
talking	c
behind	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

They	c
signed	c
my	c
diary	c
and	c
took	c
a	c
photo	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Being	c
a	c
security	c
guard	c
was	c
the	c
hardest	c
task	c
.	c

Carrying	c
big	c
speakers	c
place	c
to	c
place	c
was	c
extremely	c
tiring	c
but	c
we	c
had	c
loads	c
of	c
laugh	c
.	c

Believe	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
I	c
put	c
make	i
up	c
on	i
one	c
famous	c
singer	c
's	c
face	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
just	c
walking	c
down	c
by	c
dressing	c
room	c
manager	c
said	c
that	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
help	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
my	c
eyes	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
her	c
room	c
and	c
helping	c
her	c
.	c

Especially	c
I	c
liked	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
advise	i
you	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
as	c
regards	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
've	c
sent	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
before	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
'll	c
be	c
an	c
exciting	c
trip	c
.	c

With	c
regard	i
to	c
the	c
date	c
of	c
the	c
trip	c
,	c
July	c
would	c
be	c
best	c
because	c
in	c
June	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
family	c
in	c
Mexico	c
and	c
in	c
August	c
school	c
begins	c

I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
camping	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
guess	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
an	c
outdoor	c
girl	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
it	c
a	c
try	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	c
tents	c
than	c
cabins	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
keen	c
on	c
sports	c
,	c
especially	c
sailing	c

I	c
've	c
practised	i
sailing	c
since	c
an	c
early	c
age	c
and	c
I	c
perfectly	c
manage	c
the	c
rigging	c
and	c
sail	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
also	c
fond	c
of	c
tennis	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
just	c
started	c
my	c
lessons	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
continue	c
practising	c
during	c
the	c
summer	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'll	c
do	c
sailing	c
and	c
tennis	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
really	c
sure	c
of	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
to	c
take	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
please	c
write	c
to	c
me	c
specifying	c
what	c
would	c
be	c
suitable	c
?	c
I	c
'd	c
appreciate	c
it	c
a	c
lot	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
shopaholic	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
I	c
spent	c
my	c
Spring	c
Break	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
in	c
Italy	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
there	c
to	c
buy	c
our	c
dresses	c
for	c
our	c
boyfriends	c
'	c
graduation	c
(	c
besides	c
other	c

They	c
had	c
invited	c
us	c
and	c
we	c
wanted	c
them	c
to	c
see	c
us	c
stunningly	c
beautiful	c
.	c

While	c
we	c
were	c
in	c
Florence	c
my	c
wallet	c
was	c
stolen	c
,	c
probably	c
by	c
a	c
gypsie	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
annoyed	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
Plaza	c
Espagna	c
in	c
Florence	c
without	c
a	c
penny	c
!	c

My	c
friends	c
lent	i
me	c
some	c
money	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
more	c
than	c
120	c
pounds	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
my	c
dress	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
accesories	c
and	c
besides	c
clothes	c
and	c
souvenirs	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
really	c
do	c
much	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
used	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
had	c
and	c
bought	c
an	c
incredible	c
pair	c
of	c
shoes	c
and	c
some	c
souvenirs	c

I	c
felt	c
really	c
bad	c
seeing	c
my	c
friends	c
buy	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
while	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
was	c
tell	c
them	c
how	c
great	c
their	c
clothes	c
were	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
window	c

experience	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
happy	c
that	c
we	c
finished	c
this	c
hard	c
work	c
.	c
I	c
worked	c
in	c
a	c
team	c
by	c
seven	c
people	c

We	c
were	c
mainly	c
on	c
work	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
lights	c
at	c
this	c
great	c
concert	c
.	c

Its	c
sounds	c
easy	c
,	c
just	c
for	c
the	c
light	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
nine	c
days	c
hard	c
work	c
to	c
mount	c
all	c
the	c
different	c
spot	c
and	c
houndreds	c
of	c
Coblights	c
on	c
the	c
right	c
place	c

Finally	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
worked	c
the	c
hohl	c
night	c
befor	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
adjust	c
the	c
laser	c
extremly	i
on	c
the	c
correct	i
position	c
.	c

We	c
spent	c
hours	c
till	c
it	c
was	c
good	c
enough	c
for	c
the	c
Technical	c
-	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
band	c
was	c
exhausted	c
about	c
this	c
great	c
laser	c
show	c
at	c
the	c
end	c

For	c
me	c
was	c
this	c
aventure	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
Best	c
.	c

It	c
shows	c
,	c
when	c
all	c
member	c
of	c
a	c
group	c
work	c
hard	c
together	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
reach	c
a	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
forgotten	c
this	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

With	c
this	c
letter	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
show	c
you	c
some	c
problems	c
I	c
had	c
last	c
week	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
with	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
introduce	c
myself	c

I	c
'm	c
Francesco	c
Schein	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
18	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
last	c
week	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
\"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
\"	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
many	c
problems	c
.	c

First	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
changed	c
and	c
his	c
performance	c
was	c
very	c
poor	c
and	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
very	c
long	c

The	c
advertisement	c
said	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
which	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
you	c
said	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
Restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
eat	i
anything	i
untill	c
we	c
got	c
home	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
your	c
faults	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
asking	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Faithfully	c
Yours	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
if	c
technology	c
has	c
totally	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
born	c
with	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
learned	c
it	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
boy	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
born	c
knowing	c
the	c
man	c
has	c
stepped	c
on	c
the	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
machines	c
which	c
have	c
helped	c
in	c
my	c
development	c
,	c
and	c
others	c
which	c
help	c
me	c
to	c
make	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

The	c
computer	c
for	c
example	c
makes	c
communication	c
much	c
easier	c
and	c
faster	c
then	c
in	c
past	c
time	c
,	c
when	c
everything	c
was	c
send	c
by	c
common	c
mail	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
took	c
weeks	c
till	c
it	c
got	c
the	c
right	c
place	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
other	c
machines	c
which	c
are	c
bad	c
for	c
the	c
environment	c
.	c

Many	c
industries	c
throw	c
their	c
contaminated	c
air	c
away	c
,	c
without	c
cleaning	c
it	c
before	c
.	c

Technology	c
has	c
to	c
move	c
further	c
so	c
it	c
can	c
solve	c
problems	c
as	c
pollution	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
live	c
better	c
and	c
longer	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
surprised	c
for	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
in	c

you	c
explained	c
to	i
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
prize	c

your	c
competition	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
Thanks	c
,	c
I	c
never	c
have	c
won	c
any	c
price	c
at	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
answer	c
your	c
requests	c

In	c
reference	c
about	c
the	c
date	c
of	c
the	c
travel	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c

because	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
I	c
am	c

at	c
the	c
University	c
and	c
I	c
only	c
have	c
July	c
to	c
take	c
my	c
holidays	c
.	c

As	c
state	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
accommodation	c
type	c
.	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c

this	c
type	c
of	c
accommodation	c
.	c

I	c

About	c
camp	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
do	c
basketball	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c

my	c
favoorate	c
hobby	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c

a	c
new	c

Finally	c

what	c

be	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c

Is	c
necesarilly	c

I	c

from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
am	c
writen	i
to	c
you	c
telling	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
began	c
when	c
ours	i
common	i
friends	c
Martha	c
,	i
ofered	i
me	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
organization	c
member	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
obviously	c
I	c

Now	c
I	c
can	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
an	c
amaizing	i
challange	i
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
never	c
did	c
anything	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

My	c
duties	c
like	c
a	c
organization	c
member	c
were	c
diferent	i
,	c
the	c
firts	c
day	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pick	c
the	c
bands	c
up	c
at	c
the	c
airport	c
,	c
for	c
it	c
I	c
hired	c
a	c
van	c

The	c
following	c
day	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
provide	c
the	c
meals	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
organization	c
staff	c
and	c
besides	c
every	c
day	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
the	c
back	c
-	c
stage	i
supporting	i
the	c
catering	c
staff	c
.	c

Particularly	c
I	c
am	c
pleased	c
to	c
had	c
know	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
pop	c
stars	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Hopping	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c

Best	c
wishes	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
/	c
Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
\"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
\"	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
been	c
in	c
London	c
for	c
spending	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
enthusiasmic	c
of	c
musicals	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
the	c
things	c
that	c
were	c
writen	i
on	c
the	c
advertisment	i
were	c
not	c
really	c
true	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
writen	i
that	c
the	c
stars	c
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
actors	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
playing	c
another	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
abosolutly	i
disapointed	i
.	c

The	c
musical	c
should	c
have	c
begun	i
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
;	c
it	c
is	c
inacceptable	c

It	c
was	c
writen	i
too	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
them	c
and	c
they	c
said	c
me	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
allow	c
to	c
do	c
any	c
discount	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
enough	c
drinks	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
say	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
it	c
was	c
not	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
therefore	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
a	c
lot	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

On	c
one	c
hand	c
nowadays	c
if	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
Paris	c
and	c
return	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
day	c
you	c
can	c
take	c
a	c
plane	c
without	c
any	c
problem	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
past	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Paris	c
from	c
Barcelona	c
and	c
come	c
back	c
in	c
one	c
day	c
.	c

Another	c
advantage	c
is	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
on	c
an	c
excursion	i
and	c
you	c
take	c
your	c
mobile	c
phone	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
get	c
lost	c
somebody	c
could	c
find	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
modern	c
technology	c
in	c
these	c
days	c
is	c
internet	i
.	c

With	c
internet	i
you	c
can	c
do	c
whatever	c
you	c
want	c
without	c
going	c
out	c
home	c
(	i
shoping	i
,	c
speaking	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
,	c
working	c
,	c
putting	c
your	c
money	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
the	c
main	c
disadvantage	c
is	c
that	c
using	c
modern	c
machines	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
difficult	c
for	c
ederly	c
people	c
;	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pratitable	c
if	c
the	c
modern	c
industries	c
train	c
people	c
about	c
using	c
modern	c
technologies	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
change	c
a	c
lot	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
increase	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c

But	c
the	c

the	c
same	c
time	c
we	c
have	c
to	c

we	c
would	c

like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c

more	c
advantage	c

we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c

how	c
the	c
programme	c
could	c
be	c
changed	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
we	c
all	c
will	c
go	c
to	c
the	c

spend	c
there	c
all	c
our	c
day	c

on	c
Wednesday	c
in	c

afternoon	c
when	c

Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
and	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
reply	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
:	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
available	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
from	c
1st	c
to	c
20th	c
because	c
my	c
university	c
will	c
be	c
closed	c
during	c
this	c
month	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c

Although	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
comfortable	c
,	c
I	c
like	c
camping	c
very	c
much	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
swimming	c
and	c
also	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
up	c
climbing	c
five	c
years	c
ago	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
as	c
well	c
because	c
I	c
practise	c
this	c
sport	c
every	c
week	i
in	c
my	c
city	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
dress	c
and	c
also	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
spend	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
have	c
asked	c
to	c
write	c
a	c
composition	c
regarding	c
the	c
questionit	c
is	c
believed	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
to	c
do	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
some	i
disavantages	c
for	c
different	c
reasons	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
queue	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
free	c
cabin	c
and	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
putting	c
on	c
some	c
clothes	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
they	c
are	c
not	c
the	c
right	c
size	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
easy	c
to	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
in	c
few	c
minutes	c
and	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
regret	c
to	c
buy	c
all	c
these	c
clothes	c
,	c
which	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
need	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
some	c
clothes	c
can	c
have	c
some	c
stains	c
on	c
and	c
you	c
haven't	c
noticed	c
this	c
before	c
buying	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
refund	c
or	c
to	c
change	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
doing	c
shopping	c
bring	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
satisfaction	c
especially	c
I	c
am	c
depressed	c
,	c
nevertheless	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
dangerous	c
for	c
my	c
wallet	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
service	c
you	c
'd	c
offered	c
me	c
last	c
Saturday	c
evening	c
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
read	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
say	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
discount	c
available	c
as	c
you	c
'd	c
assured	c
in	c
the	c
add	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
check	c
the	c
information	c
before	c
print	c
it	c
!	c

I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
right	c
time	c
(	c
19.30	c
)	c
that	c
evening	c
but	c
the	c
play	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
'	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
,	c
started	c
almost	c
an	c

And	c
nobody	c
told	c
me	c
why	c
!	c

When	c
the	c
play	c
began	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
had	c
been	c
changed	c
and	c
the	c
new	c
one	c
was	c
n't	c
good	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
after	c
the	c
performance	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
reparations	c
.	c

Why	c
did	c
n't	c
you	c
say	c
something	c
about	c
it	c
?	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
the	c
'	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
'	c
you	c
'd	c
promised	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
your	c
service	c
was	c
terrible	c
.	c

Please	c
answer	c
my	c
letter	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
be	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

'	c
How	c
Has	c
Modern	c
Technology	c
Changed	c
My	c
Daily	c
Life	c
?	c
'	c

This	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
simple	c
question	c
because	c
I	c
got	c
used	c
to	c
dealing	c
with	c
technology	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
try	c
to	c
explain	c
you	c
how	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
computer	c
until	c
I	c
was	c
eight	c
.	c

Then	c
my	c
brother	c
and	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
develop	c
a	c
new	c
ability	c
.	c

In	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
used	c
the	c
computer	c
only	c
to	c
play	c
with	c
its	c
video	c
games	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
thirteen	c
I	c
discovered	c
a	c
completely	c
different	c
use	c
for	c
my	c
computer	c
.	c

It	c
became	c
scencial	c
to	c
do	c
my	c
homework	c
.	c

And	c
years	c
later	c
it	c
enabled	i
me	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
job	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
my	c
mother	c
got	c
a	c
terrible	c
disease	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
operated	i
on	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
very	c
scared	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
talked	c
to	c
the	c
doctor	c
we	c
felt	c
more	c
relaxed	c
because	c
he	c
answered	c
us	c
that	c
the	c
operation	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
simple	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
my	c
mother	c
had	c
got	c
ill	c
ten	c
years	c
before	c
,	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
survive	c
.	c

The	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
better	c
now	c
than	c
what	c
it	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
these	c
arguments	c
have	c
explained	c
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	c
,	c
haven't	c
they	c

Now	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
your	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
delighted	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
price	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
date	c
,	c
I	c
only	c
can	c
go	c
on	c
July	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
off	c
on	c
holiday	c
on	c
August	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
start	c
university	c
on	c

The	c
place	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
is	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
I	c
'd	c
feel	c
more	c
confortable	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
nice	c
of	c
you	c
to	c
let	c
me	c
choose	c
my	c
favourite	c
activities	c
.	c

The	c
ones	c
I	c
'm	c
most	c
keen	c
on	c
are	c
Tennis	c
,	c
in	c
which	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'm	c
pretty	c
good	c
since	c
I	c
took	c
some	c
classes	c
last	c
year	c
,	c
and	c
Painting	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
hobbies	c
,	c
and	c
helps	c
me	c
to	c
relax	c
myself	c
and	c
forget	c
about	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
bad	c
at	c
painting	c
either	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
everyone	c
in	c
my	c
family	c
likes	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
includying	c
myself	c

Anyway	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
questions	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
:	c
What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
for	c
California	c
weather	c
in	c
summer	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
waiting	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
sorry	c
I	c
haven't	c
written	c
until	c
now	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
always	c
very	c
busy	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
in	c
my	c
last	c
letter	c
,	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
worked	c
for	c
a	c
pop	c
band	c
,	c
and	c
helped	c
them	c
at	c
a	c
concert	c
in	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
!	c

Basically	c
my	c
work	c
was	c
carrying	c
the	c
instruments	c
,	c
the	c
speakers	c
and	c
the	c
lights	c
from	c
the	c
vans	c
to	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
not	c
an	c
easy	c
work	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
exactly	c
light	c
stuff	c

But	c
the	c
most	c
exciting	c
part	c
was	c
meeting	c
the	c
band	c
,	c
mainly	c
the	c
singer	c
and	c
the	c
drummer	c
who	c
are	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
also	c
good	c
-	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
working	c
for	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
they	c
call	c
me	c
soon	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
be	c
the	c
happiest	c
girl	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
them	c
again	c

I	c
'd	c
better	c
leave	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
write	c
again	c
soon	c

Dear	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
win	c
this	c
prize	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
make	c
me	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c

only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
set	c
my	c
holidays	c

month	c
since	c
last	c
January	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
a	c
log	c
cabins	c
like	c

because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
suffering	c
from	c
my	c

,	c
therefore	c
I	c

be	c
pleased	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
paint	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c

.	c

I	c
selected	c

is	c
a	c
cure	c
against	c
my	c
backace	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
practiced	c

I	c
started	c
my	c
new	c
job	c
five	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c

How	c
many	c
times	c
have	c
we	c
heard	c
people	c
complaining	c
about	c
shopping	c
?	c

Sometimes	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
happy	c
to	c
do	c
shopping	c

but	c
why	c
?	c

Therefore	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
the	c
case	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
offer	c
some	c
thing	c
to	c
someone	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
you	c
try	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
present	c
to	c
make	c
receive	c
happy	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
also	c
good	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
know	c
what	c
you	c
want	c

For	c
example	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
a	c
new	c
track	c
suit	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
sport	c
shop	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
waste	c
your	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
shops	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
opposite	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
disenjoyable	c

Shopping	c
is	c
boring	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
with	c
people	c
too	c
fussy	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
never	c
happy	c
with	c
what	c
they	c
get	c
and	c
see	c
.	c
They	c
always	c
find	c
a	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
with	c
people	c
who	c
just	c
look	c
around	c
the	c
shops	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
stupid	c
,	c
they	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
goal	c
.	c

They	c
waste	c
their	c
time	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
agree	c
with	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
shopping	c
with	c
some	c
people	c
and	c
kind	c
of	c
shops	c
I	c
will	c
kill	c
myself	c
because	c
I	c
waste	c
my	c
time	c
.	c

To	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c

Circle	c
Theatre	c
in	c
London	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
tourist	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
a	c
few	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
enjoied	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
presented	c
some	c
night	c
ago	c
;	c
and	c
the	c
actor	c
's	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
performance	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
19.30	c
o'clock	c
but	c
,	c
with	c
my	c
surprise	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
remain	c
here	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
because	c
I	c
left	c
London	c
,	c
with	c

Then	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Some	c
days	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
school	c
was	c
ending	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
her	c
friends	c
decided	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
party	c
for	c
their	c
friend	c
,	c
Frances	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
and	c
the	c
Francis	c
's	c
birthday	c
were	c
the	c

That	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
secret	c
for	c
Francis	c
-	c
and	c
they	c
decided	c
the	i
program	c
and	c
the	c
present	c
,	c
a	c
new	c
gold	c

Peter	c
and	c
Sue	c
asked	c
to	c
Francis	c
some	c
help	c
for	c
their	c
exam	c
's	c
subjets	c
and	c
Francis	c
,	c
for	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
,	c
was	c
very	c
busy	c
all	c
the	c

The	c
last	c
day	c
all	c
the	c
friends	c
went	c
to	c
Pat	c
's	c
home	c
with	c
food	c
,	c
musical	c
instruments	c
,	c
tape	c
recorder	c

Pat	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
afternoon	c
she	c
had	c
phoned	c
at	c
a	c
Francis	c
's	c
mother	c
and	c
she	c
explained	c
her	c
the	c
secret	c
,	c
then	c
she	c
phoned	c
at	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
she	c
speak	c
about	c
that	c
too	c
;	c
she	c
phoned	c
at	c
many	c
people	c
all	c
the	c
day	c
.	c

Now	c
many	c
people	c
knew	c
the	c
secret	c
but	c
Pat	c
said	c
everyone	c
:	c
\"	c
I	c
tell	c
you	c
a	c
small	c
secret	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
speak	c
,	c

In	c
the	c
night	c
Francis	c
was	c
invited	c
to	c
the	c
party	c
,	c
at	c
Pat	c
's	c
home	c

When	c
he	c
was	c
out	c
he	c
needed	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
cigarettes	c
so	c
he	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
where	c
the	c
owner	c
,	c
a	c
his	c
friend	c
,	c
ask	c
him	c
if	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
about	c
his	c
present	c
,	c
the	c
new	c
gold	c
watch	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
lucky	c
to	c
have	c
best	c
friends	c
like	c
Pat	c
and	c
her	c

The	c
Francis	c
's	c
secret	c
was	c
discovered	c
!	c

Now	c
all	c
the	c
Pat	c
's	c
friend	c
do	c
n't	c
tell	c
her	c
about	c
their	c
secrets	c
because	c
Pat	c
is	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
show	c
called	c
\"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
\"	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
in	c
many	c
points	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
spoke	c
about	c
two	c
actors	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
them	c
we	c
had	c
two	c
others	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
really	c
bad	c

So	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
surprised	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
you	c
started	c
the	c
show	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
boring	c
for	c
everybody	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
we	c
appreciate	c
the	c
show	c
properly	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
in	c
your	c
advert	c
you	c
spoke	c
about	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
case	c
.	c

No	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

Then	c
you	c
offered	c
people	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
staff	c
to	c
welcome	c
the	c
people	c
.	c

You	c
offered	c
something	c
impossible	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
this	c
reasons	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
your	c
understand	c
my	c
request	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
reply	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

yours	c
sincerely	c


Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

The	c
nightmare	c
started	c
at	c
this	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
though	c
she	c
was	c
a	c
really	c
good	c
friend	c
but	c
I	c
made	c
a	c
mistake	c
.	c

She	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
my	c
secret	c
and	c
everybody	c
knew	c
which	c
boy	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
tell	c
me	c
yet	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
came	c
in	c
class	c
everybody	c
was	c
looking	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
this	c
boy	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
looked	c
at	c
her	c
and	c
she	c
became	c
pale	c
and	c
suddently	c
left	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
followed	c
her	c
and	c
caught	c
her	c
to	c
push	c
her	c
on	c
the	c
ground	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
ready	c
to	c
fight	c
but	c
somebody	c
stopped	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
class	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
home	c
.	c

My	c
Mum	c
was	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
all	c
the	c
story	c
.	c

She	c
said	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
strong	c
and	c
did	c
n't	c
care	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
class	c
and	c
everybody	c
was	c
laughing	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
the	c
boy	c
told	c
them	c
to	c
stopped	c
because	c
he	c
loved	c
me	c
and	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

At	c
this	c
time	c
all	c
the	c
girls	c
became	c
jealous	c
and	c
stopped	c
to	c
laugh	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
pleasure	c
to	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
and	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
thanks	c
for	c
organising	c
a	c
school	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
the	c
programme	c
list	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Especially	c
to	c
the	c
science	c
museum	c
because	c
we	c
all	c
doing	c
science	c
in	c
school	c
.	c

Recently	c
,	c
some	c
students	c
have	c
seen	c
an	i
advertisment	c
about	c
a	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
in	c
London	c
.	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
want	c
to	c
go	c

So	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	i
greatful	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
give	c
us	c
this	c
opportunity	c
to	c
watch	c
the	c
show	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c
something	c
else	c
because	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
have	c
not	c
been	c
to	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
show	c
And	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
incredible	c
if	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
watch	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

So	c
could	c
you	c
give	c
us	c
permission	c
to	c
go	c
?	c

We	c
also	c
can	c
suggest	c
how	c
the	c
originally	c
programme	c
can	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
have	c
free	c
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
shopping	c
instead	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
during	c
that	c
period	c

We	c
are	c
all	c
looking	c
forward	c
for	c
you	c
answer	c

12	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c

Because	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
man	c
had	c
a	c
serious	c
car	c
accident	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
walking	c
pass	c
him	c
.	c

Nobody	c
had	c
noticed	c
him	c
because	c
it	c
happened	c
at	c
night	c
and	c
the	c
car	c
had	c
actually	c
crashed	c
into	c
the	c
bushes	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
thinking	c
'	c
what	c
should	c
I	c
do	c
?	c
'	c
I	c
haven't	c
got	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
with	c
me	c
And	c
I	c
was	c
half	c
way	c
between	c
my	c
school	c
and	c
home	c

At	c
that	c
time	c
he	c
was	c
unconcious	c
,	c
I	c
kept	c
asking	c
myself	c
'	c
should	c
I	c
wake	c
him	c
up	c
or	c
try	c
to	c
use	c
my	c
unsure	c
first	c
aid	c
skill	c
to	c
deal	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
struggling	c
because	c
I	c
knew	c
if	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
help	c
him	c
,	c
he	c
would	c
die	c
in	c
a	c
short	c
time	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
to	c
this	c
man	c
,	c
my	c
first	c
move	c
was	c
to	c
check	c
was	c
there	c
any	i
solid	c
or	c
liquid	c
which	c
could	c
blocked	c
his	c
breathe	c
.	c

And	c
checking	c
his	c
body	i
condition	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
turned	c
on	c
the	c
car	c
light	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
tell	c
the	c
passing	c
cars	c
.	c

I	c
ran	c
back	c
home	c
for	c
help	c
.	c

I	c
phoned	c
to	c
police	c
And	c
told	c
the	c
whole	c
story	c
.	c

The	c
strange	c
thing	c
happened	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
back	c
to	c
that	c
man	c

The	c
car	c
and	c
the	c
man	c
were	c
not	c
there	c
anymore	c
.	c

Where	c
could	c
they	c
be	c
?	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
.	c

Oh	c
,	c
sorry	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
in	c
this	c
road	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
road	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
:	c

I	c
just	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
with	c
the	c
good	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
for	c
winning	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
glad	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
planning	c
to	c
go	c
but	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
on	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
log	c
cabins	c
rather	c
than	c
tents	c
because	c
two	c
weeks	c
is	c
quite	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
privacy	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
swimming	c
and	c
singing	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
join	c
others	i
in	c
these	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
an	c
average	i
swimmer	c
and	c
as	c
a	c
singer	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
start	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
fun	c
to	c
share	c
my	c
songs	c
with	c
the	c
holiday	c
makers	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
please	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
recomendations	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
the	c
food	c
there	c
to	c
make	c
my	c
budget	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
these	c
wonderful	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
sometimes	c
is	c
really	c
boring	c
specially	c
when	c
you	c
buy	c
at	c
the	c
supermarkets	c
almost	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
the	c
same	c
things	c
like	c
cleaning	c
products	c
and	c
the	c
ingredients	c
for	c
every	c
day	c
food	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
everything	c
looks	c
different	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
present	c
for	c
someone	c
in	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

I	c
start	c
thinking	c
what	c
she	c
or	c
he	c
prefer	c
and	c
I	c
try	c
my	c
best	c
buying	c
something	c
apropiate	c
does	c
n't	c
matter	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
does	c
it	c
cost	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
you	c
spend	c
shopping	c
you	c
put	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
effort	c
choosing	c
things	c
and	c
making	c
decissions	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
or	c
less	c
important	c
,	c
or	c
more	c
or	c
less	c
enjoyable	c
depends	c
on	c
what	c
,	c
why	c
,	c
where	c
and	c
who	c
is	c
the	c
person	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
interested	c
to	c
please	c

I	c
DIDN'T	c
KNOW	c
VERY	c
WELL	c
THE	c

BECAUSE	c
ALL	c

I	c
JUST	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
explain	c
to	c
you	c
the	c
problems	c
regarding	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	c
main	c
actor	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
played	c
in	c
the	c
show	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
forty	c
-	c
five	c
minutes	c
later	c
and	c
this	c
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
there	c
was	c
not	c
discounts	c
for	c
ticket	c
,	c
while	c
you	c
wrote	c
the	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
,	c
by	c
the	c
time	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
finished	c
,	c
it	c
had	c
already	c

Definetely	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
your	c
if	c
it	c
was	c
possible	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
pretty	c
and	c
kind	c
girl	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
had	c
this	c
bad	c
habit	c

This	c
was	c
her	c
only	c
fault	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
friends	c
but	c
nobody	c
trusted	c
her	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
why	c
she	c
decide	c
to	c
change	c
her	c
behaviour	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
given	c
a	c
chance	c
:	c
if	c
she	c
had	c
been	c
able	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
everybody	c
a	c
secret	c
for	c
a	c
short	c
time	c
,	c
her	c
friends	c
would	c
have	c
started	c
trusting	c

The	c
secret	c
was	c
about	c
a	c
surprise	c
-	c
party	c
for	c
her	i
bestfriend	i
's	i
birthday	c
.	c

As	c
soon	c
as	c
the	c
arrangement	c
for	c
the	c
party	c
started	c
,	c
she	c
began	c
to	c
feel	c
nervous	c
and	c
anxious	c
because	c
she	c
wanted	c
to	c
tell	c
everything	c
to	c
her	c
bestfriend	i
.	c

But	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
days	c
went	c
by	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
surprised	c
because	c
she	c
realized	c
she	c
was	c
getting	c
used	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
secrets	c
any	c

The	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
party	c
arrived	c
and	c
Pat	c
succeeded	c
in	c
keeping	c
the	c
secret	c
.	c

All	c
her	c
friends	c
were	c
amazed	c
at	c
her	c
change	c
and	c
started	c
trusting	c
her	c
at	c
once	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
\"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
\"	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
was	c
not	c
...	c

Pleas	c
apologise	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
many	c
mistakes	c
and	c
problems	c
on	c
the	c
note	c
you	c
have	c
made	c
,	c
which	c
disappointed	c
me	c
very	c

I	c
thought	c
that	c
Dany	c
Brook	c
who	c
is	c
my	c
favorite	i
actor	c
play	c
in	c
that	c
show	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
Jeremy	c
Brook	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
be	c
so	c
kind	c
and	c
mind	c
correct	c
this	c
mistake	c
.	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
gratefull	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
correct	c
too	c
that	c
show	c
start	c
at	c
20.15	c
not	c
on	c
19.30	c
.	c

Other	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
which	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
cooker	c
sikness	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

That	c
evening	c
which	c
should	c
be	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
was	c
in	c
fact	c
very	c
tireing	c
and	c
boring	c
.	c

Apologise	c
me	c
for	c
disturb	c

am	c
looking	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
he	c
's	c
very	c
talkative	c
person	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
nessesery	c
because	c
I	c
wanted	c
him	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
main	c
director	c
of	c
that	c
birthday	c
party	c
for	c
tenes	c

It	c
started	c
a	c
week	c
before	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

Pat	c
found	c
the	c
great	c
place	c
for	c
the	c
party	c
called	c
\"	c
Blue	c
Box	c
\"	c

I	c
made	c
a	c
beautifull	i
invite	c

for	c
every	c

a	c

\"	c

and	c
I	c
made	c
a	c
perfect	c
decoration	c
with	c
ballons	i
and	c
other	c
party	c
stuff	c
.	c

Everyone	c
told	c
us	c
it	c
was	c
breath	c
taking	c

Everything	c
was	c
set	c
...	c
the	c
day	c
and	c
hour	c
came	c

Everyone	c
gathered	c
in	c
disco	i
at	c
21.00	c

We	c
were	c
only	c
waiting	c
for	c
Agatha	c
who	c
should	c
come	c
at	c
22	c
o'clock	c
with	c
her	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
exaiting	c

We	c
put	c
off	c

then	c
the	c

I	c
just	c

She	c
entered	c

and	c
everyone	c
shouted	c
HAPPY	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
touched	c
that	c
we	c
started	c
to	c
cry	c
.	c

Enyway	c
the	c
disco	i
was	c
great	c
,	c
music	c
also	c

We	c
had	c
fun	c
to	c
5	c
o'clock	c
!	c

Agatha	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
greatest	c
present	c
she	c
could	c
ever	c
get	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
/	c
Mrs	c

I	c
've	c
seen	c
your	c
festival	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
suggestions	c
to	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
really	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

And	c
your	c
last	c
festival	c
was	c
very	c
intresting	i
too	c
.	c

But	c
also	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
notes	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
improve	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
to	c
make	c
it	c
absolutelly	c
wonderful	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
you	c
must	c
invite	c
artists	c
and	c
stars	c
from	c
more	c
countries	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
people	c
only	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
can	c
make	c
your	c
festival	c
more	c
popular	c
.	c

Jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
are	c
amazing	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
are	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
so	c
not	c
everybody	c
can	c

Your	c
dance	c
shows	c
are	c
very	c
beautiful	c
,	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
is	c
something	c
original	c
and	c
exciting	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
writers	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
one	c
reasonably	c
-	c
priced	c
weekend	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
is	c
exellent	i
idea	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
so	c
Expensive	c
as	c
buying	c
ticket	c
to	c
each	c
event	c
,	c
and	c
with	c
this	c
ticket	c
you	c
can	c
visit	c
everything	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
continue	c
to	c
making	c
your	c
festivals	c
.	c

Your	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Dear	c
Tom	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

The	c
question	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
original	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
rules	c
are	c
n't	c
same	c
in	c
schools	c
of	c
our	c
country	c
.	c

Every	c
school	c
has	c
it	c
's	c
own	c
rules	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
my	c
school	c
is	c
very	c
democratic	c
and	c
so	c
there	c
are	c
very	c
good	c
relations	c
between	c
teachers	c
and	c
students	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
all	c
very	c
friendly	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
and	c
we	c
help	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
when	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
main	c
rule	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
is	c
regarding	c
theachers	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
many	c
things	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
are	c
very	c
kind	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
know	c
that	c
their	c
son	c
will	c
do	c
everything	c
right	c

And	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
Why	c
our	c
family	c
is	c
so	c
friendly	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
because	c
we	c
haven't	c
go	c
many	c
rules	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
is	c
n't	c
something	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c

I	c
hope	c
everything	c
is	c
good	c
in	c
your	c
family	c
and	c
your	c
school	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c

so	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
.	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
comfort	c
and	c
the	c
better	c
bed	c

I	c
have	c
choosen	i
the	c

I	c
'm	c

What	c

of	c
clothes	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
is	c
shopping	c
fun	c
and	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
reasons	c
that	c
could	c
be	c
awful	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
you	c
run	c
out	c
of	c
money	c
or	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
particular	c
thing	c
which	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
find	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
once	c
this	c
problem	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
a	c
special	c
fruit	c
.	c

The	c
sales	c
assistants	c
in	c
the	c
stores	c
are	c
n't	c
so	c
nice	c
and	c
helpful	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
they	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
bad	c
feeling	c
as	c
,	c
,	c
customer	c
treat	c
with	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
shopping	c
with	c
my	c
younger	c
brother	c
.	c
Awful	c

He	c
wanted	c
everything	c
what	c
his	c
eyes	c
saw	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
stuff	c
for	c
children	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
level	c
as	c
they	c
have	c
their	c
eyes	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
,	c
I	c
felt	c
tired	c
and	c
unsatisfy	c
the	c
store	c

The	c
shops	c
have	c
bad	c
opening	c
times	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
feel	c
me	c
comfortable	c
for	c
shopping	c
everything	c
will	c
be	c
closed	c
or	c
you	c
haven't	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
look	c
around	c
.	c

My	c
conclusion	c
on	c
these	c
points	c
are	c
not	c
so	c
bad	c
.	c
I	c
like	c
shopping	c
at	c
all	c
with	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

Dear	c

I	c

your	c

Basketball	c

Shoping	i
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Ten	c
or	c
fifteen	c
years	c
ago	c
we	c
had	c
in	c
Poland	c
empty	c
shelves	c
in	c
shops	c

We	c
could	c
only	c
buy	c
things	c
from	c
Russia	c
.	c

People	c
alwas	c
queued	c
for	c
stuff	c
from	c
west	c

If	c
you	c
had	c
wanted	c
something	c
special	c
for	c
example	c
for	c
a	c
gift	c
you	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
line	c
all	c
night	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
side	c
of	c
shopping	c
in	c
Poland	c
couple	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
we	c
have	c
capitalism	c
,	c
free	c
market	c
lots	c
of	c
privete	c
shops	c
,	i
markets	c
and	c
super	i
-	c

We	c
can	c
buy	c
everything	c
what	c
about	c
we	c
imagine	c
.	c

Polish	c
super	c
market	c
are	c
not	c
Polish	i
origin	c
shops	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
imported	c
from	c
enother	i
Western	i
Europe	c
country	c

I	c
apprieciate	c
this	c
shops	c
for	c
lots	c
of	c
products	c
,	c
cheep	c
prices	c
end	c
big	c
spaces	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
problem	c
is	c
when	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
only	c
one	c
thing	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
bread	c
.	c

On	c
Friedy	c
evening	c
and	c
at	c
on	c
the	c
weekdays	c
each	c
supermarkets	c
are	c
crowded	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
filled	c
by	c
people	c
who	c
went	c
buy	c
everything	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
crowded	c
places	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
shopping	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
communicate	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competion	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
answering	c
your	c
questions	c
and	c
then	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
travel	c
and	c
accomodation	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
June	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
exams	c
at	c
University	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
the	c
exact	c
date	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
tell	c
you	c
I	c
am	c
only	c
free	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
an	c
accomodation	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
keen	c
on	c
tents	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

As	c
regard	c
as	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
practise	c
painting	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
painter	c
in	c
oils	c
from	c
life	c
and	c
my	c
subjects	c
are	c
landscapes	c
,	c
people	c
,	c

I	c
like	c
also	c
taking	c
photographs	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
during	c
my	i
journeys	c
or	c
trips	c

So	c
when	c
I	c
go	c
back	c
home	c
I	c
can	c
use	c
my	c
best	c
pictures	c
to	c
reproduce	c
them	c
as	c
a	c
painting	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
clothes	c
to	c
wear	c
there	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
also	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
can	c
bring	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

There	c
is	c
somebody	c
who	c
says	c
that	c
'	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
'	c
and	c
who	c
is	c
happy	c
only	c
when	c
can	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
first	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
when	c
you	c
must	c
do	c
so	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
or	c
for	c
duty	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
run	c
from	c
one	c
shop	c
to	c
another	c
and	c
always	c
looking	c
at	c
the	c
watch	c
,	c
doing	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
terrible	c
activity	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
walk	c
without	c
anytime	c
problem	c
with	c
a	c
good	c
friend	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

For	c
istance	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
funny	c
enter	c
a	c
clothes	c
shop	c
and	c
try	c
on	c
a	c
skirt	c
or	c
a	c
t	c
-	c
shirt	c
although	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
buy	c
anything	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
I	c
enjoy	c
wasting	c
money	c
and	c
buying	c
useful	c
things	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
often	c
like	c
getting	c
gifts	c
for	c
my	c
relatives	c
and	c
friends	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
relaxing	c
above	c
all	c
on	c
Saturdays	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
finished	c
a	c
work	c
week	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
expecting	c
a	c
wonderful	c
Sunday	c

And	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
returned	c
to	c
my	c
university	c
by	c
August	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabin	c
rather	c
than	c
in	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
used	c
to	c

narrow	c
space	c
and	c
feel	c
more	c
comfortable	c
with	c
a	c

like	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c

my	c
hobbies	c
and	c
my	c
fasinative	c
in	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Sorry	c
for	c
I	c
haven't	c
written	c
to	c
you	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
good	c
excute	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
partly	c
in	c
the	c
concert	c
teams	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
one	c
that	c
I	c
never	c
thougth	c
and	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
amazing	c
was	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
is	c
my	c
responsible	c
until	c
they	c
called	c
me	c
to	c
trained	c
.	c

What	c
a	c
surprised	c
!	c
and	c
unbelieveable	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
looking	c
after	c
the	c
pop	c

You	c
might	c
understand	c
how	c
excited	c
I	c
was	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
though	c
it	c
.	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
taken	c
care	c
of	c
them	c
during	c
a	c
break	c
,	c
served	c
a	c
drink	c
,	c
clothes	c
,	c
even	c
brought	c
them	c
some	c
cigaratte	c
and	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
so	c
hospitality	c
and	c
warm	c
with	c
people	c
around	c
them	c
.	c
You	c
know	c

because	c
of	c
these	c
are	c
change	c
all	c
my	c
opinions	i
about	i
self	i

important	c
behavior	c

The	c
most	c
appreciated	c
was	c
they	c
've	c
given	c

their	c
latate	c
CD	i
with	i
signature	c

Marvellous	c

to	c

about	c
your	c

during	c
my	c
summer	c
holiday	c

Love	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
foreign	c
student	c
who	c
is	c
on	c
holidays	i
here	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
stay	c
here	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
three	c
days	c
ago	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
horrible	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
dissapointed	i
with	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
explain	c
you	c
my	c
experience	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
Monday	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
with	c
two	c
friends	c

We	c
arrived	c
on	c
time	c
but	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
was	c
delayed	c
untill	i
half	c
-	i
pass	c
eight	c

Moreover	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
n't	c
any	c
disscount	c
for	i
beeing	c
students	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
changed	c
for	c
another	c
and	c
nobody	c
told	c
us	c
.	c

When	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
restful	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
which	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
late	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
.	c

Well	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
bad	c
day	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
there	c
was	c
some	c
things	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
n't	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
answer	c
me	c
soon	c
.	c

Yous	i
sincerelly	i

Our	c
lives	c
are	c
changing	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
had	c
different	c
entertainments	c
that	c
the	c
actually	c
children	c
had	c
n't	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
play	c
with	c
our	c
toys	c
,	c
dolls	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
enjoy	c
without	c
a	c
computer	c

We	c
had	c
n't	c
so	c
many	c
machines	c
than	c
they	c
have	c
.	c

The	c
technology	c
is	c
growing	c
and	c
growing	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
computer	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
have	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
important	c
but	c
some	c
times	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
wrong	c
thing	c
because	c
the	c
children	c
can	c
see	c
it	c
too	c
.	c

Moreover	c
you	c
can	c
change	c
the	c
TV	c
programme	c
without	c
getting	c
up	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
find	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
,	c
sports	c
on	c
our	c
TV	c
-	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	c
science	c
is	c
changing	c

We	c
have	c
more	c
researchers	c
than	c
some	c
years	c
ago	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
solution	c
of	c
lots	c
of	c
problems	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
cure	c
illness	c
which	c
were	c
very	c
dangerous	c
before	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
in	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
years	c
we	c
will	c
see	c
cured	c
some	c
illness	c
like	c
cancer	c
,	c
UTH	c
.	c

The	c
new	c
technology	c
is	c
changing	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
You	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
feelings	c
about	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
there	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
been	c
at	c

I	c
also	c
hope	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
festival	c
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c

The	c
great	c
idea	c
of	c
making	c
it	c
\"	c
international	c
\"	c
was	c
unfortunately	c
not	c
brought	c
to	c
life	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
artists	c
(	c
mentioned	c
to	c
be	c
\"	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
\"	c
)	c

Maybe	c
the	c
eason	c
for	c
that	c
is	c
very	c
simple	c
:	c
lack	c
of	c
money	c

It	c
would	c
explain	c
,	c
why	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
simply	c
too	c
small	c
-	c
you	c
just	c
could	c
n't	c
afford	c
bigger	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
to	c
choose	c
impressed	c
me	c
most	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organizing	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
more	c
next	c
year	c

I	c
also	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
excellent	c
idea	c
of	c
one	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
,	c
which	c
allowed	c
me	c
to	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
was	c
interested	c
in	c
.	c

My	c
suggestion	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
is	c
simple	c
-	c
please	c
make	c
it	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
longer	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Friend	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
-	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
receive	c
it	c

If	c
you	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
school	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
write	c
about	c
them	c
in	c
a	c
nutshell	c
.	c

We	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
many	c
school	c
rules	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
teachers	c
are	c
rather	c
liberal	c

We	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
any	c
special	c
uniforms	c
on	c
signs	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Some	c
rules	c
are	c
really	c
simple	c
:	c
we	c
must	c
be	c
at	c
school	c
on	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
must	c
not	c
disturb	c
others	c
during	c
the	c
classes	c

We	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
smoke	c
cigarettes	c
or	c
drink	c
alcohol	c
of	c
course	c
!	c

In	c
winters	c
we	c
are	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
shoes	c
.	c

It	c
may	c
sound	c
funny	c
,	c
but	c
mud	c
,	c
gravel	c
and	c
snow	c
lying	c
on	c
the	c
school	c
's	c
floors	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
nice	c
sight	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
change	c
our	c
schoes	i
without	c
questioning	c
that	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
used	c
to	c
write	c
exams	c
which	c
are	c
in	c
polish	i
schools	c
very	c
often	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
many	c
rules	c
either	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
wash	c
the	c
dishes	c
from	c
time	c
to	c
time	c
(	c
I	c
sometimes	c
try	c
to	c
avoid	c
this	c
unpleasant	c
duty	c
)	c
and	c
clean	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
there	c
is	c
anything	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
pleased	c
with	c
my	c
situation	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
pleased	c
with	c
yours	c
!	c

Your	c

in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c

Because	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c

and	c
in	c
June	c
,	c
I	c
will	c

Also	c
,	c
in	c
Augost	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
studying	c
a	c
summer	c
English	c
course	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c

Because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
somewhere	c
which	c
differs	c
from	c
my	c
home	c
and	c
every	c
days	c
comforts	c
,	c
in	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c

However	c
,	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
is	c
written	c
some	c
activities	c
.	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
Basketball	c
and	c
Tennis	c

Basketball	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
in	c
a	c
team	c
,	c
of	c
my	c
town	c
for	c
ten	c
years	c

Also	c
Tennis	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
hobby	c
and	c
I	c
play	c
twice	c
every	c
week	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
to	c
you	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
told	c
me	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c

Will	c
we	c
need	c
any	c
special	c
clothes	c
and	c
How	c
much	c
you	c
would	c
suggest	c
me	c
to	c
carry	c
for	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c

to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
well	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
explain	c
my	c
experience	c
with	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
;	c
last	c
month	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
help	c
them	c

Every	c
day	c
of	c
that	c
month	c
I	c
was	c
trying	c
to	c
advertise	c
this	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
markets	c
to	c
schools	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
giving	c
information	c
when	c
and	c
where	c
the	c
group	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
appear	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
where	c
can	c
they	c
buy	c
or	c
book	c
a	c
ticket	c
for	c
this	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
,	c
It	c
was	c
difficult	c
and	c
tired	c
but	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
a	c
lot	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
break	c
from	c
the	c
routine	c

Because	c
I	c
did	c
it	c
for	c
first	c
time	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
felt	c
wonderful	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
concert	c
had	c
succesed	c
and	c
every	c
day	c
was	c

Because	c
I	c
believed	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
a	c
result	c
which	c
came	c
with	c
my	c
help	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
again	c
it	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
fantastic	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c

you	c

the	c
programme	c

All	c

are	c
very	c
pleased	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
know	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
for	c
three	c
days	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
'll	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
use	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
bigger	c
city	c
in	c
the	c
world	c

London	c
is	c
the	c
place	c
to	c
be	c
when	c
always	c
something	c
happening	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
your	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
we	c
like	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
sightseeing	c
by	c
our	c
and	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c

The	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
changes	c
in	c
the	c
programme	c
?	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
the	c
14th	c
between	c
10.00-	c
13.00	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
is	c
the	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
latest	c
fashion	c
,	c
find	c
about	c
make	c
up	c
and	c
hairstyles	c

And	c
all	c
of	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
,	c

According	i
to	c
your	c
programme	c
we	c
have	c
the	c
science	c
Museum	c
which	c
is	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
then	c
shopping	c
.	c

Would	c
it	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Museum	c
and	c
then	c
for	c
the	c
shopping	c
in	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
which	c
is	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
?	c

All	c
students	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
greatful	i
.	c

your	c
sincerly	i

I	c
think	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
home	c
is	c
something	c
which	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
.	c

Home	c
sweet	i
home	c
.	c

We	c
call	c
home	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
we	c
live	c
or	c
the	c
country	c
where	c
we	c
come	c
frome	i
.	c

Anyway	c
home	c
is	c
always	c
the	c
place	c
to	c
go	c
because	c
is	c
ours	c
we	c
feel	c
save	c
and	c
comfortable	c
.	c

Home	c
sweet	i
home	c
.	c

After	c
hard	c
work	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
to	c
have	c
our	c
corner	c
where	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
able	c
to	c
rest	c
and	c
relax	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
home	c
might	c
be	c
just	c
the	c
place	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
sleep	c
.	c

We	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
very	c
busy	c
world	c
!	c

Working	c
long	c
hours	c
,	c
doing	c
plenty	c
of	c
activieties	c
,	c
going	c
out	c
,	i
going	c

We	c
even	c
do	c
n't	c
spend	c
time	c
with	c
families	c
.	c

Propably	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
we	c
might	c
be	c
to	c
busy	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
our	c
own	c
home	c
and	c
spend	c
some	c
time	c
there	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
it	c
alway	i
will	i
be	c
place	c
to	c
go	c
!	c
We	c
find	c
our	c
family	c
there	c
and	c
our	c
life	c

Some	c
of	c
us	c
have	c
been	c
living	c
in	c
one	c
house	c
since	c
they	c
were	c
born	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
sentimental	c
and	c
we	c
have	c
memory	c
from	c
the	c
past	c
.	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
life.lf	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
/	c
Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
which	c
you	c
advertised	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
the	c
show	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
on	c
6th	c
June	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
with	c
something	c
which	c
did	c
not	c
match	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
seen	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
his	c
play	c
.	c

He	c
did	c
not	c
play	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

It	c
made	c
me	c
sad	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
starting	c
time	c
has	c
been	c
changed	c
from	c
19:30	c
to	c
20:15	c
.	c

We	c
waited	c
for	c
ages	c
because	c
we	c
had	c
not	c
been	c
informed	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
although	c
you	c
advertised	c
the	c
discounts	c
tickets	c
available	c
,	c
they	c
do	c
not	c
sale	c
them	c
any	c
more	i
according	i
to	c
your	c
staff	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
in	c
your	i
theater	i
after	c
the	c
show	c

It	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
staff	c
trainning	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
can	c
understand	c
my	c
disappointment	c
.	c
I	c
must	c
insist	c
that	c
you	c
refund	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
the	c
show	c

Unless	c
I	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
within	c
ten	c
days	c
,	c
I	c
shall	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
legal	c
advice	c
on	c
the	c
matter	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
believed	c
that	c
our	c
life	c
style	i
has	c
been	c
changed	c
by	c
mordern	i
technology	c
such	c
as	c
computers	c
and	c
washing	c
machine	c
etc	c
.	c

Especially	c
for	c
families	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
found	c
very	c
expensive	c
to	c
buy	c
them	c
but	c
there	c
are	c
number	c
of	c
advantages	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
dishwashers	c
are	c
very	c
effecient	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
work	c
full	c
time	c
and	c
look	c
after	c
my	c
children	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
cook	c
and	c
wash	c
dishes	c
after	c
working	c
.	c

Before	c
buying	c
my	c
dishwasher	c
I	c
asked	c
my	c
son	c
to	c
wash	c
them	c
.	c

He	c
complained	i
about	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
computers	c
are	c
useful	c
for	c
us	c
as	c
well	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
somewhere	c
if	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
information	c
,	c
for	i
example	i
traveling	c

However	c
my	c
family	c
's	c
members	c
do	c
less	c
communicate	c
with	c
each	c
other	c
than	c
we	c
used	c
to	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
children	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
playing	c
computer	c
games	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
the	i
morden	c
technology	i
make	c
our	i
life	i
style	i
combinient	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
for	c
us	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
think	c
about	c
more	c
carefully	c
when	c
we	c
buy	c
something	c
for	c
our	c
children	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
/	c
Madam	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
my	c
horrible	c
evening	c
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
on	c
10th	c
June	c
2000	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
for	c
entertaining	c
but	c
I	c
wish	c
I	c
'd	c
not	c
go	c
there	c
because	c
everythings	i
went	i
wrong	i
.	c

I	c
bought	c
a	c
ticket	c
at	c
the	c
box	c
office	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
for	c
student	c
like	c
you	c
said	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
on	c
that	c
day	c
it	c
delaied	c
about	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
expected	c
to	c
meet	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
Robert	c
Alan	c
and	c
Jack	c
Ruby	i
instead	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

It	c
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

After	c
finishing	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
and	c
I	c
found	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
sign	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
restaurant	c
\"	c
sorry	c
we	c
closed	c
because	c
special	c
reasons	c
\"	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
what	c
was	c
the	c
reasons	c
for	c
that	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
refund	c
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
back	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
horrible	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
that	c
why	c
our	c
great	c
plan	c
for	c
horiday	c
were	c
not	c
be	c
real	c
.	c

It	c
happened	c
in	c
last	c
summer	c
we	c
planed	i
to	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
the	c
Southen	c
part	c
of	c
Thailand	c
by	c
motorbike	c
but	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
tell	c
our	c
parents	c
because	c
they	c
would	c
n't	c
allow	c
us	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

We	c
started	c
our	c
journey	i
and	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
our	c
purpose	c
place	c
by	c
6	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

The	c
sun	c
was	c
shining	c
and	c
wind	c
were	c
breezing	c
like	c
we	c
had	c
imaged	c
.	c

Whlile	c
I	c
was	c
standing	c
on	c
the	c
beach	c
suddenly	c
I	c
heard	c
someone	c
called	c
my	c
name	c
and	c
said	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
,	c
that	c
right	c
,	c
she	c
is	c
my	c
mum	c

She	c
told	c
me	c
Pat	c
had	c
phoned	c
her	c
while	c
we	c
were	c
going	c
and	c
my	c
mum	c
followed	c
us	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
so	c
dangerous	c
to	c
went	c
by	c
bicycle	c
.	c

Eventhrough	c
we	c
could	c
spend	c
our	c
holiday	c
there	c
but	c
with	c
my	c
mum	c
and	c
I	c
just	c
found	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
fantasy	c
time	i
which	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
though	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

From	c
now	c
on	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
something	c
secrets	c
to	c
Pat	c
because	c
she	c
always	c
tell	c
someone	c
else	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
I	c
received	c
yestarday	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
proud	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
extremely	c
happy	c
to	c
spend	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c

At	c
the	c
beginning	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
questions	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
appropriate	c
month	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
is	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
boss	c
promised	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
this	c
month	c
off	c
(	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
charge	c
of	c
project	c
which	c
starts	c
in	c
June	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
later	c
)	c

'	c
As	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
choise	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
to	c
tents	c
because	c
they	c
seem	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
so	c
depended	c
on	i
weather	i
conditions	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
was	c
requested	c
I	c
should	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
choose	c
climbing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

These	c
two	c
are	c
easy	c
to	c
connect	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
climb	c
and	c
make	c
pictures	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
photography	c
.	c

Last	c
year	c
I	c
took	c
part	c
in	c
photograher	c
's	c
contest	c
and	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
second	c
prize	c
in	c
Poland	c
in	c
cathegory	c
of	i
,	i
,	c
beautiful	c
scenery	c
''	c

Climbing	c
,	c
in	c
contrast	c
,	c
is	c
something	c
I	c
started	c
few	c
months	c
ago	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
gained	c
any	c
success	c
in	c
this	c
sport	c

But	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
get	c
more	c
familier	i
with	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
clothes	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
formal	c
ones	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
also	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
spending	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
is	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
ones	c
more	c
for	c
taking	c
me	c
into	c
consideration	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Juliana	c
Piotrowska	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
been	c
to	c
a	c
big	c
supermarket	c
and	c
tried	c
to	c
find	c
something	c
you	c
really	c
like	c
or	c
want	c
,	c
looking	i
throug	i
shelves	c
and	c
not	c
finding	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
end	c

What	c
did	c
you	c
feel	c
?	c

You	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
disappointed	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
situations	c
which	c
could	c
make	c
you	c
feel	c
similar	c
while	c
you	c
do	c
shopping	c
.	c

You	c
might	c
spend	c
too	c
much	c
money	c
and	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
need	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
also	c
buy	c
something	c
which	c
later	c
turns	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
out	c
of	c
order	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Very	c
often	c
a	c
shop	c
assistant	c
is	c
not	c
helpful	c
so	c
you	c
lose	c
your	c
money	c
and	c
your	c
time	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
face	c
an	i
agressive	c
and	c
maybe	c
even	i
drunk	c
shop	c
assistant	c
or	c
manager	c

This	c
leads	i
to	c
an	c
escalation	c
of	c
your	c
anger	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
you	c
could	c
find	c
a	c
bargain	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
happy	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
dress	c
or	c
a	c
suit	c
for	c
a	c
good	c
price	c
.	c

But	c
at	c
home	c
you	c
noticed	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
tear	c
on	c
sleeve	c
.	c

And	c
you	c
could	c
n't	c
of	c
course	c
give	c
it	c
back	c
because	c
the	c
price	c
was	c
lowered	c
and	c
your	c
dress	c
is	c
not	c
under	c
guarantee	i
.	i

You	c
could	c
also	c
face	c
an	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
which	c
you	c
presented	c
on	c
last	c
saturday	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
out	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
during	c
our	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
quite	c
pleasant	c
time	i
except	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

Actually	c
it	c
spoiled	c
our	c
time	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
back	c
our	c
money	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
some	c
points	c
I	c
want	c
mention	c
about	c
the	c
differencies	c
between	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
and	c
the	c
realities	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
expectation	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
plays	c
his	c
role	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
had	c
never	c
shown	c
up	c
that	c
night	c

The	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
an	c
unknown	c
actor	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
such	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
only	c
at	c
20:15	c

It	c
was	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
suppose	c
to	c
be	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
such	c
boaring	c
to	c
wait	c
the	c
show	c
in	c
a	c
noisy	c
and	c
hot	c
theatre	c
.	c

Third	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
no	i
possibility	i
of	c
discount	c

The	c
girl	c
sold	c
the	c
tickets	c
was	c
laughing	c
at	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
mention	c
about	c
the	c
discounts	c
availability	c
was	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Forth	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
not	c
on	c
the	c
door	c
saying	c
that	c
the	c
painting	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
the	c
weekend	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
you	c
arrange	c
work	c
like	c
that	c
?	c

Finally	c
the	c
sentence	c
was	c
written	c
blow	c
down	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
absolutely	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
most	c
imperfect	c
evening	c
out	c
I	c
ever	c
exprienced	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
provide	c
a	c
better	c
service	c
next	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
this	c
time	c
you	c
need	c
give	c
back	c
the	c
money	c
we	c
paid	c
.	c

Sincerely	c

Yu	c
Phu	c
Tung	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
moved	c
to	c
London	c
to	c
study	c
English	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
hard	c
time	c
to	c
make	c
intimate	c
friendship	c
with	c
people	c
around	c
me	c
.	c

First	c
it	c
was	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
culture	c
difference	c
.	c

It	c
took	c
quite	c
long	c
time	c
to	c
adjust	c
in	c
the	c
multi	c
culture	i
in	i
the	c
language	c
institue	c
.	c

Secondly	c
the	c
language	c
ability	c
was	c
another	c
issue	c
.	c

Even	c
I	c
could	c
meet	c
some	c
friend	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
express	c
my	c
heat	c
to	c
them	c
for	c
we	c
have	c
different	c
back	c
ground	c
and	c
our	c
first	c
language	c
were	c
different	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
wished	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
can	c
share	c
everything	c
is	c
going	c
in	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
met	c
Pat	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
a	c
such	c
wonderful	c
person	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
.	c

She	c
tried	c
to	c
help	c
others	c
when	c
they	c
have	c
difficult	c
time	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
she	c
realized	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
always	c
been	c
outside	c
of	c
circle	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
she	c
invited	c
me	c
to	c
her	c
flat	c
.	c

Since	c
then	c
we	c
have	c
visited	c
each	c
other	c
often	c
and	c
spent	c
time	c
together	c
in	c
weekend	c
usally	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
fantastic	c
time	c
together	c
for	c
three	c
monthes	c
.	c

Even	c
we	c
could	c
make	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
Paris	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
holiday	c
!	c

We	c
had	c
many	c
common	c
interests	c
in	c
music	c
,	c
art	c
and	c
books	c

I	c
thought	c
that	c
I	c
found	c
a	c
good	c
friend	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
everything	c
about	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
some	c
stories	c
I	c
never	c
told	c
anyone	c
before	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
share	c
with	c
her	c
all	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Few	c
days	c
later	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
about	c
my	c
secret	c
love	c
story	c
,	c
it	c
became	c
a	c
top	c
gossip	c
among	c
my	c
classmate	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
nightmare	c
!	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
/	c
madam	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
your	c
congratulations	c
.	c

I	c
never	c
thought	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
win	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
wonderful	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
stay	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
at	c
Portsmouth	c
College	c
and	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
term	c
is	c
23	c
June	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
all	c
right	c
for	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

And	c
for	c
my	c
accommodation	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
relax	c
there	c
and	c
enjoy	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
when	c
I	c
live	c
in	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
activities	c
in	c
water	c
and	c
my	c
favourite	c
activity	c
is	c
swimming	c
.	c

Before	c
I	c
came	c
England	c
,	c
I	i
swam	i
every	c
weekend	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
even	c
in	c
winter	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
choose	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
swimming	c
and	c
sailing	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c

Actually	c
,	c
my	c
mind	c
has	c
already	c
gone	c
there	c
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
wait	c
even	c
for	c
a	c
minute	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
now	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
the	c
shopping	c
especially	c
for	c
clothes	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
for	c
myself	c

And	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
exchange	c
money	c
before	c
I	c
go	c
there	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c

be	c

you	c

me	i
accomodation	c

not	c

on	c
living	c
in	c
the	c
countryside	c
and	c
especially	c
in	c

In	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

As	c
requested	c
,	c
I	c
visited	c
some	c
classes	c
during	c
the	c
lesson	c
and	c
some	c
other	c
rooms	c
while	c
activities	c
were	c
taking	c
place	c
.	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
make	c
a	c
series	c
of	c
suggestions	c
on	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
an	c
extremely	c
good	c
advertisement	c
for	c
our	c
school	c
if	c
you	c
take	c
plans	c
from	c
the	c
lesson	c
of	i
Chemistry	c
in	c
the	c
laboratory	c
,	c
because	c
our	c
laboratory	c
is	c
new	i
,	c
recognised	c
as	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
in	c
the	c
area	c
as	c
it	c
has	c
a	c
huge	c
amount	c
of	c
instruments	c
and	c
really	c
some	c
very	c
good	c
professors	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
many	c
experiments	c
are	c
taking	c
place	c
in	c
this	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
take	c
plans	c
from	c
a	c
match	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
team	c
in	c
the	c
football	c
field	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
completely	c
new	c
and	c
full	c
equiped	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
also	c
plans	c
from	c
the	c
school	c
's	c
Nursery	c
as	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
facilities	c
for	c
the	c
children	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
parents	c
can	c
recognise	c
that	c
the	c
teachers	c
are	c
very	c
good	c

I	c
think	c
also	c
that	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
general	c
plans	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
area	c
as	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
huge	c
background	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
declare	c
that	c
my	c
myself	c
and	c
my	c
fellow	c
students	c
will	c
be	c
available	c
to	c
help	c
to	c
this	c
short	c
video	c
by	c
all	c
means	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
delightful	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
saying	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
a	c
two	c
-	c
week	c
holiday	c
in	c
your	c
recent	c
competition	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
all	c
paid	c
in	c
advance	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
which	c
will	c
help	c
you	c
organize	c
all	c
the	c
necessary	c
details	c
of	c
the	c
forthcoming	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
arrange	c
a	c
date	c
after	c
the	c
20th	c
of	c
July	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
problems	c
beyond	c
my	c
control	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
abroad	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
allergic	c
to	c
many	c
plants	c
and	c
insects	c
and	c
I	c
should	c
avoid	c
contacting	c
them	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
wonderful	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
variety	c
of	c
activities	c

at	c
the	c
camp	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
photography	c
and	c
swimming	c
I	c
am	c
hoping	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
came	c
second	c
last	c
year	c
's	c
swimming	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
enrolled	c
photography	c

In	c

extra	c
money	c
and	c
thick	c
clothes	c
with	c
me	c

Could	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
terribly	c
sorry	c
not	c
to	c
drop	c
you	c
a	c
line	c
since	c
the	c
last	c
time	c
we	c
wrote	c
to	c
one	c
another	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
finally	c
got	c
around	c
writing	c
and	c
you	c
'll	c
see	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
definetly	i
worth	i
waiting	i
as	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
great	c
and	c
unbeliavable	c
news	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
on	c
half	c
-	c
term	c
school	c
holiday	c
and	c
have	c
plenty	c
of	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
much	c
more	c
different	c
things	c
apart	c
from	c
studying	c
my	c
A	c
-	c
level	c
history	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
meeting	c
up	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
visiting	c
interesting	c
places	c
or	c
even	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
on	c
my	c
own	c

However	c
this	c
term	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
far	c
cry	c
from	c
the	c
others	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
see	c
why	c
I	c
'm	c
describing	c
it	c
as	c
the	c
most	c
unforgettible	c
one	c
when	c
you	c
read	c
through	c
my	c
letter	c
.	c

Couple	c
of	c
days	c
ago	c
I	c
bumped	c
into	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
who	c
is	c
into	c
music	c
and	c
we	c
started	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chat	c
about	c
what	c
we	c
had	c
both	c
been	c
doing	c
.	c

She	c
invited	c
me	c
to	c
the	c
rehearsal	c
of	c
a	c
huge	c
consert	i
whose	c
singer	c
was	c
a	c
well	c
-	c
known	c
pop	c
star	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
my	c
favorite	i
.	c

Can	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
introduced	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
I	c
took	c
numerous	c
photographs	c
some	c
of	c
which	c
I	c
put	c
in	c
the	c
envelope	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
dream	c
come	c
true	c
,	c
and	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
experience	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c

I	c
helped	c
out	c
my	c
friend	c
by	c
writing	c
huge	c
billboards	c
and	c
making	c
some	c
light	c
refreshments	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
felt	c
exhausted	c
I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
days	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
througout	c
my	c
life	c

write	c
me	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
trip	c
that	c
you	c
planned	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
students	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
chance	c
to	c
meet	c
new	c
people	c
and	c
visit	c
a	c
beautiful	c
city	c
like	c
London	c

Your	c
programme	c
is	c
excellent	c
because	c
it	c
tries	c
to	c
offer	c
to	c
the	c
students	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
spend	c
our	c
time	c
without	c
wasting	c
time	c
in	c
silly	c
places	c
or	c
events	c
.	c

We	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
because	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
happening	c
shows	c
how	c
you	c
are	c
dedicated	c
with	c
our	c
school	c
and	c
the	c
students	c
that	c
study	c
there	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
great	c
to	c
visit	c
especially	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
because	c
of	c
its	c
expositions	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
's	c
something	c
that	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
.	c

The	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
will	c
start	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
expositions	c
of	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
of	c
the	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
,	c
of	c
the	c
new	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
clothes	c
and	c
people	c
teaching	c
how	c
to	c
make	c
up	c

Our	c
suggestion	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
change	c
the	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
leisure	c
time	c
to	c
the	c
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

By	c
this	c
way	c
,	c
the	c
leisure	c
time	c
would	c
be	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
the	c
attention	c
and	c
we	c
're	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Famous	c
People	c
x	c
Media	c

Famous	c
people	c
are	c
special	c
for	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
society	c
.	c

They	c
form	c
opinions	c
and	c
invent	c
new	c
fashion	c
styles	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
the	c
media	c
is	c
expanding	c
its	c
ways	c
of	c
communication	c
so	c
they	c
need	c
more	c
information	c
.	c
The	c
media	c
is	c
starting	c
to	c
get	c
into	c
the	c
private	c
life	c
of	c
these	c
famous	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
important	c
to	c
respect	c
other	c
people	c
lives	c
because	c
it	c
can	c
cause	c
serious	c
problems	c
in	c
the	c
family	c
of	c
the	c
person	c
or	c
in	c
his	c
life	c
.	c

If	c
the	c
famous	c
person	c
does	c
n't	c
mind	c
in	c
being	c
filmed	c
in	c
his	c
personal	c
life	c
there	c
's	c
no	c
problem	c
.	c

But	c
if	c
the	c
politicians	c
or	c
the	c
film	c
stars	c
ask	c
for	c
privacity	c
the	c
media	c
has	c
to	c
respect	c
.	c

Everybody	c
likes	c
to	c
be	c
with	c
your	c
family	c
without	c
any	c
reporter	c
or	c
photographer	c
.	c

In	c
summary	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
try	c
to	i
extract	c
from	c
these	c
people	c
their	c
best	c
qualities	c
and	c
not	c
try	c
to	c
find	c
things	c
that	c
could	c
irritate	c
them	c
like	c
familiar	c
problems	c
or	c
personal	c
problems	c

The	c
respect	c
is	c
essential	c
.	c

They	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
like	c
any	c
common	c
person	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
/	c
Mss	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	c
in	c
complain	c
about	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
visited	c
last	c
evening	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
last	c
evening	c
with	c
great	c
pleasure	c
,	c
however	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
worse	c
evening	c
in	c
my	c
life	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
different	c
from	c
those	c
who	c
were	c
advertised	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
althoug	c
I	c
read	c
that	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c

More	c
over	c
after	c
watching	c
a	c
show	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
it	c
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
my	c
dream	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
still	c
my	c
dream	c
because	c
of	c
your	c
show	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
no	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
understand	c
my	c
situation	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
other	c
people	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
show	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
return	c
my	c
money	c

Yours	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
techology	i
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Fifty	c
years	c
ago	c
people	c
even	c
did	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
after	c
2000	c
years	c
they	c
would	c
have	c
another	c
life	c
.	c

When	c
Thomas	c
Adison	c
invented	c
an	c
electric	c
light	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
greatest	c
invention	c
for	c
people	c
of	c
that	i
centure	i

And	c
nowadays	c
modern	c
technology	c
can	c
change	c
all	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
mean	c
,	c
almost	c
everyone	c
has	c
now	c
a	c
car	c
,	c
a	c
computer	c
,	c
a	c
mobil	c
phone	c
and	c
even	c
an	c

My	c
life	c
is	c
changing	c
too	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
now	c
I	c
can	c
phone	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
parents	c
from	c
every	c
place	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
chat	c
with	c
other	c
foreign	c
teenagers	c
with	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
the	c
internet	c
.	c

Second	c
modern	c
technology	c
helps	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
kitchen	c
.	c

Coocking	c
became	c
faster	c
with	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
the	c
microwave	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
Modern	c
technology	c
prevents	i
different	c
illnesses	c
.	c

Further	c
more	c
,	c
yesterday	c
I	c
've	c
heard	c
that	c
every	c
man	c
could	c
fly	c
to	c
the	c
space	c
without	c
any	c
experience	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
great	c
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
in	c
2050	c
year	c
everybody	c
will	c
fly	c
to	c
the	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
people	c
can	c
atrophided	c
of	c
all	c
this	c
inventions	c
.	c

He	c
become	c
lazy	c
because	c
they	c
know	c
that	c
they	c
can	c
seat	c
on	c
the	c
sofa	c
and	c
turn	c
the	c
chances	c
on	c
the	c
TV	c
by	c
pressing	c
a	c
boton	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
inspite	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
in	c
future	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
new	c
inventions	c
and	c
they	c
will	c
stop	c
our	c
disasters	c
and	c
problems	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
good	c
programme	c
you	c
organised	c
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

Especially	c
the	c
sightseeing	c
by	c
bus	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	c
something	c
:	c
There	c
is	c
a	c
trendy	c
event	c
about	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
;	c
make	c
up	c
and	c
hairstyles	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c

It	c
is	c
called	c
,	c
,	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c

This	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
intrested	i
in	c
clothes	c
,	c
sports	c
and	c
fashion	c

I	c
have	c
almost	c
forgotten	c
to	c
mention	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
!	c

Unfortunately	c
we	c
realised	c
that	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
we	c
will	c
already	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
lasts	c
nine	c
hours	c
,	c
from	c
10.00	c
-	c
19.00	c
,	c
the	c
whole	c

Our	c
question	c
now	c
:	c
Could	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
show	c

We	c
could	c
maybe	c
change	c
Tuesday	c
's	c
programme	c
to	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
prefer	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
free	c
time	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
important	c
for	c
us	c

Please	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
and	c
give	c
us	c
an	c
answer	c
.	c

Thanks	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Dear	c
Jack	i

Thanks	c
a	c
lot	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
fine	c
but	c
quite	c
busy	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
German	c
exams	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
read	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
's	c
,	c
,	c
Best	c
Detective	c
Stories	c
of	c
Agatha	c

I	c
can	c
really	c
recommend	c
you	c
this	c
book	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
fabulous	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
suitable	c
present	c
for	c
your	c
cousin	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
.	c

One	c
story	c
is	c
about	c
ten	c
persons	i
who	c
stay	c
together	c
in	c
a	c
hotel	c
on	c
a	c
lonely	c
island	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
storm	i
and	c
they	c
can	c
not	c
leave	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
a	c
murderer	c
happens	c
!	c

Believe	c
me	c
,	c
you	c
would	c
never	c
guess	c
who	c
the	c
killer	c
is	c

There	c
is	c
also	c
Hercule	c
Poirot	c
,	c
the	c
famous	c
detective	c
and	c
he	c
finally	c
solves	c
the	c
mistery	c

But	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
tell	c
you	c
more	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
read	c
it	c
yourself	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
your	c
cousin	c
likes	c
crime	c
stories	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
perfect	c
book	c
!	c

Unfortunately	c
it	c
is	c
quite	c
expensive	c
,	c
£	c
32	c
.	c

But	c
do	c
not	c
worry	c
about	c
the	c
price	c
because	c
your	c
cousin	c
will	c
love	c
it	c
!	c

Okay	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
have	c
news	c
from	c
you	c
very	c
soon	c

Have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
/	c
Madam	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
telling	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
have	c
requested	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
for	c
me	c
to	c

Because	c
my	c
course	c
wo	c
n't	c
finish	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
college	c
to	c
get	c
ready	c
for	c
the	c
new	c
term	c

Then	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
tents	c
for	c
my	c
accommodation	c
when	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
is	c
funnier	i
than	c
others	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
at	c
Camp	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
Basketball	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
sport	c
I	c
play	c
most	c
,	c
I	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
used	c
to	c
win	c
the	c
first	c
place	c
in	c
school	c
-	c
wide	c
match	c
when	c
we	c
was	c

And	c
the	c
other	c
one	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
painting	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
;	c
Painting	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
learning	c
it	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
5	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
'm	c
still	c
doing	c
it	c
once	c
I	c
have	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

Above	c
are	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
asked	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
here	c
are	c
something	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
;	c
first	c
is	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
,	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c

And	c
another	c
question	c
is	c
what	c
is	c
the	c
prices	c
of	c
things	c
like	c
in	c
there	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
make	c
a	c
better	c
buget	c
of	c
my	c
trip	c
.	c

Look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
;	c
I	c
knew	c
you	c
would	c
interested	c
at	c
my	c
experience	c
of	c
helping	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
time	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
it	c

The	c
place	c
we	c
worked	c
was	c
a	c
football	c
pitch	c
;	c
we	c
spent	c
3	c
days	c
on	c
setting	c
up	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
the	c
equitment	c
,	c
and	c
the	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
nothing	c
very	c
important	c
I	c
did	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
the	c
right	c
people	c
to	c
do	c
it	c

I	c
only	c
put	c
the	c
speakers	c
in	c
the	c
right	c
places	c
,	c
or	c
helping	c
engieners	c
tested	c
the	c
lights	c
.	c

But	c
at	c
the	c
brakes	i
and	c
after	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
the	c
engieners	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
leant	c
something	c
about	c
setting	c
up	c
the	c

The	c
fourth	c
day	c
,	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
the	c
players	c
have	c
been	c
to	c
there	c
to	c
test	c

Then	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
speak	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

From	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
learnt	c
more	c
about	c
instruments	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
date	c
of	c
concer	i
came	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
concer	c
finished	c
successfully	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
happier	c
than	c
ever	c
because	c
the	c
succeed	i
inclueded	c
my	c
work	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
enjoyable	c
moment	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
stop	c
to	c
finish	c
my	c
homework	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
letter	c
again	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
named	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
.	c

Regarding	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
LONDON	c
'S	c
NEWEST	c
AND	c
BEST	c
MUSICAL	c
SHOW	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
deeply	c
disappointed	c
at	c
it	c

According	i
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	i
starrings	i
were	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
AND	c
TINA	c
TRUELOVE	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
because	c
of	c
its	c
starrings	i
,	i
but	c
at	c
the	c
day	c
I	c
saw	c
it	c
,	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
played	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
not	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
.	c

Moreover	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
ticket	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
all	c
sold	c
out	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
said	c
they	c
were	c
very	c
few	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
£	c
20	c
ticket	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
was	c
delayed	c

It	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
fourty	i
five	c
minutes	c
later	c
!	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
had	c
already	c
closed	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
for	c
this	c
awful	c
night	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
satisfactory	c
reply	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Especially	c
,	c
a	c
computer	c
has	c
made	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
change	c
dramatically	c

It	c
is	c
only	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
years	c
since	c
I	c
have	c
used	c
a	c
computer	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
wonder	c
how	c
I	c
can	c
live	c
without	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
open	c
my	c
e	c
-	c
mail	c
box	c
every	c
night	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
find	c
a	c
new	c
message	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

Before	c
using	c
e	c
-	c
mail	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
write	c
letters	c
and	i
sometime	i
telephon	c

However	c
I	c
've	c
found	c
e	c
-	c
mail	c
is	c
better	c
than	c
them	c
.	c

Because	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
I	c
send	c
my	c
message	c
,	c
they	c
can	c
receive	c
it	c

In	c
the	c
other	c
word	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
also	c
receive	c
their	c
reply	c
soon	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
really	c
useful	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
need	c
quick	c
reply	c

Overmore	c
when	c
I	c
send	c
e	c

,	c
I	c
need	c
not	c
worry	c
about	c
the	c
time	c

I	c
can	c
send	c
them	c
anytime	c
I	c
like	c
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
I	c
enjoy	c
chatting	c
with	c
my	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
/	c
Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
\"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
\"	c
which	c
I	c
saw	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
last	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
far	c
from	c
what	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
expecting	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c

However	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
not	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
that	c
day	c

Secondally	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
late	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
without	c
doing	c
anything	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
thought	c
that	c
there	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
discounts	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
which	c
in	c
fact	c
was	c
not	c
available	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
normal	c
price	c
.	c

Furthur	c
more	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
delay	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
without	c
eating	c
a	c
dinner	c
,	c
though	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
hungry	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
evening	c
was	c
terrible	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
known	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
changed	c
my	c
plan	c
and	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
better	c
time	c

I	c
strongly	c
suggest	c
you	c
should	c
give	c
us	c
right	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
claim	c
some	c
refund	c
for	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
this	c
matter	c
will	c
receive	c
your	c
prompt	c
attention	c

Fashion	c
in	c
100	c
years	c

If	c
you	c
compare	c
the	c
fashion	c
now	c
with	c
that	c
of	c
100	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
you	c
'll	c
notice	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
incredably	c
big	c
difference	c
between	c
them	c

People	c
have	c
become	c
more	c
informal	c
,	c
casual	c
and	c
practical	c
than	c
before	c

But	c
how	c
about	c
the	c
fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
100	c
years	c
from	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
'll	c
also	c
be	c
very	c
different	c
from	c
now	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
which	c
way	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
people	c
might	c
think	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
function	c
of	c
clothes	c
than	c
the	c
design	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
they	c
'll	c
wear	c
a	c
cloth	c
which	c
protect	c
themselves	c
from	c
air	c
pollution	c
,	c
sunshine	c
etc	c
.	c

Imagine	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
have	c
masks	c
on	c
their	c
mouthes	c
and	c
noses	c
like	c
we	c
have	c
sun	c
-	c
glasses	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
masks	c
are	c
designers	c
brands	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
made	c
of	i
special	c
material	c
to	c
prevent	c
us	c
from	c
breathing	c
in	c
polluted	c

It	c
's	c
like	c
a	c
joke	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
bit	i
scarely	c

Imagine	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
have	c
hats	c
with	c
big	c
edges	c
to	c
protect	c
their	c
faces	c
from	c
sun	c
-	c
burn	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
most	c
trendy	c
fashion	c
of	c
the	c

It	c
's	c
funny	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
never	c
know	c
!	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
/	c
Madam	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
had	c
been	c
to	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
but	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
singers	c
are	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
unknown	c
actor	c
in	c
that	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
later	c
at	c
20:15	c
which	c
was	c
very	c
different	c
in	c
'	c
19.30	c
'	c
as	c
shown	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
at	c
all	c
which	c
is	c
in	c
contrast	c
with	c
'	c
Discounts	c
Availabe	c
'	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
something	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
and	c
found	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
no	c
reason	c
.	c

The	c
real	c
show	c
on	c
it	c
owns	c
is	i
really	c
very	c
different	c
to	c
what	c
are	c
mentioned	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
unsatisfied	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Please	c
would	c
you	c
also	c
change	c
the	c
advertisement	c
to	c
the	c
level	i
of	i
the	c
actual	i
facts	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
attention	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

What	c
will	c
clothes	c
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
hard	c
thing	c
to	c
predict	c
.	c

The	c
fashion	c
of	c
nowaday	i
clothings	i
is	c
just	c
keep	c
on	c
changing	c
.	c

Although	c
some	c
may	c
appears	i
again	c
after	c
few	c
years	c
different	c
styles	c
are	c
developed	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
depends	c
on	c
the	c
people	c
's	c
own	c
personalities	c
and	i
develope	c
their	c
own	c
styles	c
which	c
suits	c
them	c
the	c
most	c

They	c
can	c
wear	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothing	c
,	c
like	c
they	c
design	c
for	c
themselves	c
or	c
those	c
like	c
history	c
can	c
wear	c
those	c
of	c
victorian	c
time	c
and	c
in	c
different	c
countries	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
colours	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
metalic	c
colours	c
,	c
especially	c
silver	c
,	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c

As	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
farbics	c
will	c
be	c
invented	c
&	c
the	i
clothings	c
will	c
never	c
be	c
just	c
cotton	c
as	c
always	c
been	c
seen	c
.	c

Maybe	c
paper	c
can	c
also	c
be	c
a	c
farbic	c
use	c
for	c
make	c
clothings	i
and	c
for	c
those	c
who	c
like	c
to	c
wear	c
new	c
clothes	c
everyday	c
.	c

They	c
can	c
be	c
thrown	c
away	c
after	c
wearing	c
it	c
and	c
light	c
enough	c
to	c
be	c
carried	c
around	c
whenever	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
your	c
wearing	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c

'm	c

the	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
cleaner	c
than	c
the	c
tents	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
'm	c
stayin	c
there	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
practise	c
tennis	c
and	c
basketball	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
both	c
sports	c
all	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
one	c
question	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
are	c
any	c
washing	c
machines	c
or	c
a	c
place	c
to	c
wash	c
our	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
this	c
letter	c
contains	i
all	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
the	c
real	c
question	c
is	c
:	c
Who	c
said	c
that	c
is	c
enjoyable	c

Maybe	c
for	c
women	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
for	c
me	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
this	c
sounds	c
horrible	c
,	c
but	c
sometimes	c
it	c
's	c
what	c
really	c
happens	c

For	c
men	c
,	c
sometimes	c
is	c
hard	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
their	c
partners	c

Sometimes	c
that	c
means	c
a	c
complete	c
tour	i
around	c
all	c
the	c
fashion	c
shops	c
in	c
town	c
.	c

And	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
stop	c
in	c
a	c
place	c
that	c
we	c
like	c

The	c
Sports	c
Shop	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
not	c
lose	c
the	c
time	c
because	c
all	c
the	c
other	c
shops	c
could	c
be	c
closed	c
when	c
you	c
arrive	c
.	c

And	c
that	c
is	c
allways	i
what	c
we	c
want	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
men	c
's	c
intention	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
to	c
go	c
a	c
big	c
area	c
.	c

Specially	c
week	c
-	c
ends	c

Everyone	c
pushing	c
a	c
trolley	c
and	c
crashing	c
around	c
.	c

People	c
should	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
license	i
to	c
drive	c
those	c
things	c
.	c

Someone	c
could	c
be	c
injured	c
.	c

And	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
time	c
to	c
pay	c

A	c
huge	c
que	i
that	c
lasts	i
half	c
an	c
hour	c
or	c
more	c
and	c
finishes	c
with	c
you	c
completely	c
freaked	c
out	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
at	c
all	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
dissapointing	i
evening	c
I	c
had	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theather	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
called	c
\"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
\"	c
.	c

According	i
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
gave	c
,	c
there	c
have	c
been	c
some	c
important	c
differents	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
late	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
on	c

Secondly	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
the	c
discounts	c
are	c
available	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
tickets	c
I	c
bought	c
they	c
were	c
no	c
discount	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
dinner	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
work	c
in	c
were	c
on	c
holidays	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
horrible	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
out	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
a	i
refound	i
of	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
wasted	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
useful	c
for	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
theather	c
to	c
cheat	c
to	c
your	c
customers	c
.	c
If	c
you	c
do	c
it	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
no	c
bussiness	c
for	c
you	c
and	c
no	c
satisfaction	c
for	c
them	c

I	c
look	c
fordwad	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Your	c
sincerely	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
change	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
useful	c
tool	c
that	c
human	c
beings	c
have	c
.	c

It	c
affects	c
everyone	c
who	c
live	c
in	c
this	c
planet	c
and	c
every	c
activity	c
made	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
focus	c
on	c
me	c
.	c

Emilio	c
Almodar	c
,	c
18	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
University	c
Student	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
career	i
I	c
have	c
choosen	c
is	c
Internacional	c

I	c
use	c
technology	c
every	c
moment	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
realise	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
come	c
back	c
home	c
from	c
university	c
and	c
I	c
call	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
using	c
it	c
because	c
at	c
home	c
we	c
have	c
very	c
modern	c
phones	c
and	c
fax	c
and	c
almost	c
everybody	c
in	c
my	c
family	c
has	c
a	c
cellular	i
phone	c
and	c
thing	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

We	c
also	c
have	c
five	c
computer	c
,	c
the	c
latest	c
versions	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
useful	c
for	c
my	c
father	c
to	c
work	c
and	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
special	c
works	c
for	c
University	c
.	c

This	c
machines	c
are	c
connected	c
to	c
Internet	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
gives	c
to	c
my	c
family	c
too	c
much	c
facility	i
to	c
get	c
every	c
information	c
we	c
want	c
,	c
from	c
how	c
to	c
prepare	c
son	c
drink	c
to	c
what	c
was	c
the	c
result	c
of	c
the	c
Sunday	c
's	c
football	c
match	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
we	c
use	c
the	c
net	c
to	c
comunicate	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
we	c
have	c
in	c
U.S.A.	i
It	i
's	c
really	c
amazing	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
spent	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
in	c
technology	c

I	c
prefer	c
playing	c
rugby	c
and	c
going	c
out	c
with	c
friends	c
,	c
because	c
technology	c
is	c
not	c
all	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
a	c
little	c
part	c
of	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
/	c
Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
theatre	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
in	c
Liverpool	c
,	c
and	c
recently	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c

First	c
day	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisement	c
which	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
it	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
only	c
one	c
actor	c
that	c
was	c
different	c
from	c
your	c
advertisement	c

Also	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
certain	c
to	c
me	c
to	c
bought	c
a	c
discount	c
tickets	c
cause	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	i
availiable	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
exactly	c
seven	c
thirty	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c

However	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

I	c
wasted	c
time	c
too	c
much	c
for	c
waiting	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
good	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
cause	c
I	c
had	c
only	c
one	c
week	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c

Moreover	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
with	c
the	c
word	c
\"	c
Stuff	c
vacation	c
\"	c
on	c
the	c
front	c
door	c
after	c
the	c
show	c

It	c
was	c
absolutely	c
different	c
from	c
your	c
leaflet	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
at	c
that	c
time	c

Could	c
you	c
do	c
me	c
my	c
half	c
of	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
enclose	c
my	c
phone	c
number	c
and	c
address	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Lo	c
Son	c
Lin	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
seen	c
the	c
film	c
star	c
wars	c
?	c

And	c
did	c
you	c
notice	c
something	c
about	c
fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
convenient	c
clothes	c
with	c
simple	c
design	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Because	c
the	c
people	c
will	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
more	c
than	c
now	c
with	c
their	c
computer	c
.	c

And	c
they	c
will	c
use	c
soft	c
cozy	i
cloths	i
like	c
cotton	c
and	c
silk	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
if	c
they	c
have	c
some	c
special	c
day	c
when	c
like	c
important	c
public	c
day	c
or	c
special	c
day	c
of	c
their	c
life	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
wear	c
very	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
which	c
was	c
you	c
never	c
seen	c
before	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
that	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
strange	c
to	c
our	c
eyes	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
of	c
others	i
will	c
be	i
familiar	c
to	c
us	c

And	c
they	c
will	c
use	c
the	c
most	c
kinds	c
of	c
things	c
like	c
small	c
stone	c
to	c
diamond	c
etc	c
.	c

Maybe	c
some	c
peoples	i
are	i
nakid	i
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
...	c

Just	c
imagine	c
the	c
way	c
of	c
future	c
people	c
's	c
life	c
.	c

And	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
the	c
their	c
clothes	c
also	c

13th	c
June	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
surprised	c
and	c
very	c
happy	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
California	c
and	c
second	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
won	c
something	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
time	c
that	c
is	c
possible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
is	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
working	c
for	c
a	c
bank	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

For	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
California	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
accommodation	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
this	c
gives	c
me	c
a	c
feeling	c
of	c
freedom	c
and	c
adventure	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
quite	c
different	c
to	c
my	c
live	c
here	c
in	c
Greece	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
mot	c
to	c
do	c
are	c
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
I	c
have	c
climbed	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
mountains	c
in	c
the	c
surrounding	i
area	i
so	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
,	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
in	c
climbing	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
'	c
surfed	c
'	c
in	c
my	c
live	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
is	c
an	c
activity	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
learn	c
.	c

Last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
things	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
:	c
What	c
kind	c
of	c
wheather	i
do	c
you	c
have	c
in	c
California	c
?	c

Is	c
it	c
very	c
hot	c
?	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

And	c
what	c
about	c
money	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
Should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Are	c
there	c
any	c
activities	c
which	c
are	c
not	c
included	c
?	c

And	c
my	c
last	c
question	c
:	c
how	c
many	i
persons	i
are	c
going	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
each	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Many	c
people	c
,	c
especially	c
women	c
,	c
love	c

If	c
you	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
centre	c
of	c
every	c
big	c
town	c
you	c
will	c
see	c
people	c
walking	c
from	c
store	c
to	c
store	c
searching	c
for	c
something	c
to	c
wear	c
or	c
to	c
buy	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

But	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
big	c
variety	c
in	c
the	c
store	c
.	c

Very	c
often	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
buy	c
because	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
only	c
three	c
or	c
four	c
different	c
sport	c
shoes	c
to	c
choose	c
from	c
,	c
not	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
out	c
of	c
twenty	c
or	c
thirty	c
such	c
as	c
Nike	c
,	c
adidas	c
or	c
Fila	c

And	c
very	c
often	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
for	c
the	c
product	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Another	c
cause	c
is	c
that	c
shops	c
and	c
stores	c
are	c
often	c
overcrowded	c
.	c

Very	c
often	c
you	c
can	c
hardly	c
move	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
crowds	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

And	c
many	c
people	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
,	c
so	c
do	c
n't	c
wonder	c
if	c
other	c
people	c
have	c
not	c
tolerance	c
and	c
patience	c
to	c
wait	c
and	c
hit	c
you	c
with	c
their	c
shopping	c
cars	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
other	c
causes	i
why	c
shopping	c
is	c
n't	c
always	c
great	c
fun	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
last	c
cause	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
becoming	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
impersonal	c
.	c

That	c
means	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
big	c
supermarkets	c
and	c
big	c
stores	c
,	c
where	i
noone	i
has	i
time	c
for	c
you	c
to	c
show	c
you	c
or	c
explain	c
things	c
to	c
you	c
such	c
as	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
bicycle	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
no	c
one	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
and	i
noone	i
to	i
complaine	i

That	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
only	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
in	c
little	c
stores	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
have	c
peace	c
and	c
quiet	c
and	c
very	c
often	c
nothing	c
to	i
complaine	i
about	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c

I	c
was	c
writting	i
as	c
reply	c
of	c
your	c
letter	c

I	c

glad	c
to	c
have	c

USA	c

About	c
the	c
information	c
that	c

tell	c

that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c

only	c
in	c

becase	c
I	c

a	c
new	c
job	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
ask	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
one	c
month	c
holidays	c
each	c
year	c
and	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
months	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
busy	c
becase	c
my	c
workmates	c
will	c
take	c
holidays	c
on	c
these	c
months	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	i
prefered	i
tents	i
becase	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
according	i
with	c
a	c
camp	c

And	c
with	c
the	c
activities	c
I	c
must	c
chose	i
Photography	c
and	c
Painting	c
becase	i
I	c
am	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Here	c
I	c
am	c
,	i
writting	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
everything	c
about	c
my	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
How	c
much	c
did	c
I	c
enjoy	c
that	c
journey	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
helping	c
to	c
carry	c
the	c
stuff	c
from	c
the	c
trucks	c
to	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
the	c
band	c
played	c
,	c
I	c
help	c
with	c
the	c
music	c
stuff	c
like	c
speakers	c
,	c
mics	c
,	c
lights	c
,	c
sound	c
,	c

And	c
later	c
the	c
band	c
arrived	c
and	c
played	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
times	c
before	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
them	c
fixing	c
the	c
last	c
details	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
I	c
was	c
preparing	c
some	c
drinks	c
for	c
the	c
band	c
because	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
finished	c
they	c
were	c
very	c
tired	c
and	c
tersty	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
only	c
help	c
with	c
tidy	c
up	c
the	c
place	c
and	c
made	c
sure	c
that	c
everything	c
was	c
under	c
control	c
and	c
clean	c
.	c

Later	c
the	c
band	c
was	c
talking	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
get	c
their	c
new	c
album	c
free	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
other	c
souvenirs	c
from	c
the	c

But	c
the	c
thing	c
that	c
particulary	i
liked	c
me	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
all	c
kind	c
of	c
things	c
just	c
in	c
one	c
day	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
feel	c
different	c
emotions	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
everything	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
tell	c
you	c
,	c
I	c
enjoy	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
have	c
another	c
experience	c
like	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
have	c
sent	c
recently	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
surprise	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

The	c
reasons	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
writing	c
,	c
However	c
,	c
is	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
details	c
of	c
my	c
trip	c
to	c

I	c
'll	c
be	c
taking	c
an	c
English	c
Examination	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
spend	c
abroad	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
accommodation	c
provided	c
can	c
be	c
either	c
tents	c
or	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
contact	c
with	c
the	c
nature	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
scenery	c
around	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
from	c
the	c
activity	c
list	c
is	c
singing	c
(	c
because	c
I	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
a	i
chorus	c
at	c
school	c
)	c
and	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
good	c
taking	c
pictures	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
way	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
feelings	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
have	c
we	c
bring	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
could	c
also	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
we	c
will	c
need	c
during	c
our	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
brochure	c
and	c
a	c
map	c
showing	c
where	c
the	c
camp	c
is	c
.	c

thanking	c
you	c
in	c
anticipation	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

What	c
a	c
surprise	c
it	c
was	c
to	c
get	c
letter	c
from	c
you	c
after	c
all	c
this	c
time	c
.	c

Sorry	c
I	c
haven't	c
written	c
for	c
so	c
long	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
busy	c
trying	c
to	c
apply	c
for	c
a	c
job	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
just	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
with	c
whom	c
I	c
worked	c
.	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
celebrate	c
the	c
125	c
aniversary	c
of	c
the	c
city	c
,	c
the	c
Coun	c
Council	c
organised	c
an	c
open	c
air	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
summer	c
night	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
citizens	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
tourists	i
,	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c

The	c
pop	c
band	c
\"	c
Five	c
\"	c
arrived	c
into	c
town	c
and	c
needed	c
people	c
to	c
help	c
with	c
not	c
only	c
the	c
organisation	c
but	c
also	i
the	c
stages	c
and	c

I	c
knew	c
some	c
help	c
was	c
needed	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
speak	c
to	c
the	c
manager	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
when	c
he	c
said	c
:	c
\"	c
O.K.	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
help	c
,	c
here	c
is	c
a	c
list	c
of	c
what	c
you	c
can	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
to	c
leave	c
some	c
leaflets	c
on	c
shops	c
,	c
restaurants	c
and	c
streets	c

Working	c
with	c
this	c
band	c
was	c
an	c
experience	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
was	c
been	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
staff	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
was	c
too	c
nervious	i
,	i
I	c
knew	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
the	c
job	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
love	c
to	c
hear	c
all	c
your	c
news	c
,	c
why	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
come	c
and	c
visit	c
me	c
?	c

Perhaps	c
I	c
could	c
show	c
you	c
the	c
pictures	c
I	c
took	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c

from	c

Love	c
from	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
dissapointment	i
about	c
the	c
play	c
\"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
\"	c
which	c
is	c
performing	c
at	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
announced	c
Mr.	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	c
the	c
principal	c
actor	c
.	c

Surprisingly	c
,	c
he	c
never	c
appeared	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
during	c
the	c
play	c

Therefore	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
or	c
the	c
company	c
is	c
lying	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
one	c
hour	c
fifteen	c
past	c
after	c

We	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
in	c
time	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
all	c
that	c
time	c
until	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
asked	c
about	c
the	c
discounts	c
,	c
an	i
agressive	c
employee	c
refused	c
to	c
answer	c
me	c
.	c

He	c
stayed	c
looking	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
laughing	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
incredible	c
.	c

The	c
evening	c
was	c
a	c
horrible	c
surprise	c
,	c
completely	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
promise	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c

Defineteley	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

\"	c
Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c

\"	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
trust	c
her	c
so	c
I	c
told	c
everything	c
about	c
Lynne	c
Harter	c
,	c
our	c
new	c
collegue	c
at	c
school	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
my	c
own	c
opinion	c

Well	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
my	c
tragedy	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
Lynne	c
was	c
ugly	c
,	c
fat	c
like	c
a	c
cow	c
,	c
and	c
extremely	c

But	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
shut	c
my	c
mouth	c
,	c
I	c
continued	c
:	c
\"	c
You	c
ca	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
Pat	c
,	c
she	c
wears	c
trousers	c
like	c
men	c
and	c
green	c
flowery	c
blouses	c
\"	c
Of	c
course	c
,	c
my	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
laughing	c
during	c

Two	c
days	c
after	c
,	c
when	c
Pat	c
came	c
back	c
to	c
my	c
school	c
and	c
she	c
met	c
Mr	c
Harter	c
,	c
our	c
head	c
teacher	c
,	c
she	c
told	c
everything	c
about	c
Ann1	c

In	c
that	c
precisely	c
moment	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
forgotten	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
that	c
Ann	c
was	c
Mr	c
Harter	c
's	c
niece	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
it	c
's	c
my	c
fault	c

But	c
,	c
well	c
,	c
unhappiness	c
started	c
with	c
Pat	c
and	c
my	c
reveilled	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
\"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
\"	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
recently	c
seeing	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
during	c
my	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
!	c
I	c
was	c
sure	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
had	c
ever	c
seen	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
good	c
publicity	c
you	c
made	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
thought	c
completely	c
wrong	c
!	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
nearly	c
an	c
hour	c
later	c
as	c
I	c
expected	c

If	c
the	c
spectacle	i
has	c
been	c
beautiful	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
been	c
quite	c
pleased	c
to	c
wait	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
have	c
been	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
true	c

So	c
it	c
's	c
better	c
not	c
to	c
write	c
anything	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
make	c
it	c
true	c
then	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
hoped	c
that	c
,	c
after	c
these	c
incidents	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
enjoy	c
myself	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
change	c
of	c

The	c
main	c
actor	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
was	c
changed	c
and	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
played	c
his	c
part	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
I	c
expected	c

Finished	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
this	c
hasn't	c
been	c
said	c
before	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
shocked	c
by	c
the	c
reason	c
for	c
which	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
:	c
the	c
chef	c
went	c
away	c
after	c
he	c
received	c
a	c
phone	c
call	c
!	c

For	c
all	c
these	c
reason	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
!	c

A	c
suggestion	c
?	c

Organize	c
better	c
your	c
shows	c
and	c
do	c
not	c
exagerate	i
with	i
publicity	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

There	c
would	c
be	c
many	c
things	c
to	c
say	c
about	c
.	c

Technology	c
is	c
a	c
wide	c
field	c
which	c
increases	c
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
creating	c
an	c
artificial	c
world	c
,	c
where	c
everything	c
is	c
electronic	c
and	c
fast	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
sure	c
if	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
life	c
in	c
positive	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

Certainly	c
,	c
thanks	c
to	c
it	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
things	c
today	c
that	c
were	c
impossible	c
a	c
few	c
centuries	c
ago	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
make	c
a	c
phone	c
call	c
with	c
an	c
astonish	c
rapidity	c
,	c
instead	c
at	c
my	c
grandparents	c
'	c
time	c
it	c
took	c
one	c
month	c
or	c
more	c
to	c
have	c
contact	c
with	c
people	c
abroad	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
only	c
means	c
of	c
communication	c
was	c
the	c
post	c
and	c
its	c
service	c
was	c
very	c
slow	c
!	c

When	c
appeared	c
the	c
first	c
car	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
already	c
a	c
great	c
success	c
.	c

Before	c
that	c
,	c
people	c
travelled	c
by	c
horse	c
or	c
worse	c
.	c

Fortunately	c
today	c
everyone	c
can	c
take	c
an	c
aeroplane	c
and	c
go	c
to	c
America	c
,	c
Australia	c
or	c
wherever	c
else	c
he	c
wants	c

What	c
can	c
I	c
say	c
about	c
the	c
television	c
?	c

It	c
allows	c
us	c
to	c
keep	c
connections	c
with	c
the	c
other	c
states	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
improves	c
our	c
knowledge	c
,	c
offers	c
us	c
news	c
,	c
advises	c
us	c
about	c
events	c
which	c
happened	c
or	c
will	c

In	c
the	c
not	c
very	c
far	c
1914	c
,	i
parent	i
sent	c
their	c
sons	c
in	c
war	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
they	c
were	c
still	c
alive	c
or	c
dead	c
!	c

It	c
's	c
terrible	c
!	c

Despite	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
convinced	c
all	c
this	c
progress	c
caused	c
some	c
damages	c
at	c
the	c
community	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
phisically	c

We	c
pay	c
less	c
attention	c
to	c
our	c
life	c
,	c
to	c
those	c
things	c
which	c
give	c
us	c
happiness	c
,	c
that	c
are	c
n't	c
money	c
,	c
success	c

We	c
became	c
passive	c
people	c
,	c
we	c
follow	c
the	c
same	c
routine	c
every	c
day	c
and	c
we	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
society	c
where	c
rules	c
are	c
strongly	c
fixed	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
everyone	c
should	c
live	c
his	c
own	c
life	c
how	c
he	c
wants	c
to	c
live	c
it	c
and	c
make	c
him	c
known	c
for	c
who	c
he	c
is	c
,	c
not	c
for	c
his	c
money	c
,	c
but	c
for	c
his	c
abilities	c
,	c
his	c
good	c
habits	c
,	c
his	c

Finally	c
,	c
everyone	c
should	i
decrease	i
his	c
own	c
life	c
's	c
rythm	c

Mr	c
John	c
Smythe	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
horrible	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
on	c
Friday	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
with	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
work	c
out	c
as	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
will	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
starring	c
actors	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
Tina	c
did	c
act	c
,	c
but	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
an	c
awful	c
actor	c
whose	c
name	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
recall	c
.	c

Second	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
was	i
suposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
used	c
to	c
waste	c
my	c
time	c
sitting	c
on	c
a	c
chair	c
waiting	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
have	c
better	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
,	c
is	c
that	c
your	c
advertised	c
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
n't	c
any	c
discount	c
at	c
all	c

To	c
finish	c
my	c
\"	i
marvelous	c
\"	c
evening	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
eat	c
at	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
no	c
reason	c

As	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
\"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
\"	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c

Pat	c
's	c
story	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Now	c
you	c
've	c
probably	c
asking	c
yourself	c
what	c
does	c
it	c
mean	c
,	c
well	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
explain	c
it	c
to	c
you	c

Two	c
years	c
ago	c
in	c
this	c
school	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
best	c
friends	c

We	c
used	c
to	c
tell	c
everything	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
having	c
some	c
family	c
problems	c
,	c
so	c
my	c
marks	c
were	c
getting	c
down	c
and	c
down	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
worried	c
,	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c

One	c
day	c
she	c
looked	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
eyes	c
with	c
a	c
sharp	c
deep	c
look	c
,	c
Never	c
have	c
I	c
seen	c
such	c
a	c
deep	c
look	c
:	c
and	c
asked	c
me	c
what	c
was	c
happening	c
and	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
as	c
I	c
always	c
used	c
to	c

That	c
afternoon	c
she	c
visited	c
me	c
and	c
told	c
me	c
a	c
plan	c
she	c
had	c
designed	c
to	c
make	c
my	c
marks	c
rise	c
.	c

It	c
consisted	c
in	c
stealing	c
the	c
school	c
list	c
from	c
the	c
computer	c
,	c
in	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
hack	c
the	c
school	c
software	c

I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
,	c
so	c
I	i
stole	c
about	c
ten	c
tests	c
we	c
were	c
planned	c
to	c
do	c

Pat	c
could	c
n't	c
stand	c
the	c
pressure	c
of	c
the	c
\"	c
crime	c
\"	c
so	c
she	c
told	c
the	c
school	c
directors	c
that	c
I	c
stole	c
the	c

I	c
was	c
punished	c
,	c
nearly	c
expelt	c
,	c
but	c
Pat	c
did	c
n't	c
receive	c
any	c

I	c
never	c
accused	c
her	c
of	c
lying	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
you	c
ask	c
me	c
why	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
do	c
n't	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
/	c
Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
after	c
visiting	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Frankly	c
speaking	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
after	c
my	c
visit	c

I	c
was	c
displeased	c
from	c
the	c
very	c
beginning	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
as	c
I	c
'm	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
I	c
could	c
have	c
one	c
but	c
in	c
reality	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

But	c
nevertheless	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
t	c
20.15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
in	c
overcrowded	c
hall	c
.	c

When	c
finally	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
started	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
for	c
my	c
visiting	c
your	c
show	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
participance	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
understand	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
was	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
the	c
restaurant	c
which	c
was	c
mentioned	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
such	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	c
as	c
was	c
promised	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
mistakes	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
gratefull	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
back	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
modern	c
technologies	c
play	c
the	c
important	c
role	c
in	c
people	c
's	c
life	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
at	c
present	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
technologies	c
are	c
computer	c
and	c
Internet	c
technologies	c
.	c

Both	c
computer	c
and	c
Internet	i
influence	c
people	c
's	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
use	c
computer	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

It	c
helps	c
me	c
in	c
preparing	c
my	c
homeworks	i
.	c

Firs	i
of	c
all	c
Internet	i
gives	c
you	c
an	c
access	c
to	c
a	c
great	c
number	c
of	c
different	c
information	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
Internet	c
is	c
often	c
used	c
for	c
entertaiment	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
it	c
's	c
also	c
used	c
in	c
different	c
business	c
and	c
education	c
process	c
!	c

With	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
Internet	i
technologies	c
I	c
communicate	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
it	c
gives	c
me	c
chance	c
to	c
improve	c
my	c
English	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	i
,	i
Internet	c
can	c
be	c
used	c
in	c
education	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
gives	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
have	c
distant	c
relations	c
between	c
pupils	c
and	c
teachers	c

Though	c
Internet	i
has	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
positive	c
aspects	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
be	c
careful	c
with	c
it	c
and	c
not	c
to	c
be	c
depended	c
on	c
it	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

At	c
the	c
begining	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
You	c
for	c
Your	c
letter	c
-	c
it	c
pleased	c
me	c
much	c

I	c
have	c
always	c
dreamt	c
about	c
holidays	c
'	c
in	c
Camp	c
California	c
'	c

However	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
problems	c
that	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
solve	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
only	c
suitable	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
is	c
July	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
from	c
my	c
duties	c
-	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
doctor	c
so	c
you	c
see	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
not	c
let	c
my	c
patients	c
down	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
are	c
talking	c
about	c
accomodation	i
then	i
accomodation	i
in	c
tents	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
-	c
I	c
love	c
being	c
close	c
to	c
the	c
nature	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
You	c
to	c
know	c
also	c
about	c
my	c
two	c
hobbys	i
:	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
telling	c
about	c
some	c
kind	c
of	c
achivements	c
in	c
those	c
discipines	c
but	c
It	c
is	c
my	c
big	c
pasion	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
practice	i
both	c
of	c
theme	c
at	c
'	c
Camp	c
California	c
'	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
also	c
one	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
You	c
about	c
.	c

The	c
question	c
is	c
:	c
Do	c
I	c
need	c
some	c
extra	c
money	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
for	c
this	c
trip	c
?	c

Yours	c

Unconected	c
part	c
of	c
every	i
people	c
lifes	i
is	c
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
buy	c
everything	c
from	c
clothes	c
to	c
food	c
and	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
that	c
could	c
stop	c
us	c
from	c
this	c
are	c
money	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
teenager	c
I	c
must	c
addmit	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
nothing	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
from	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
like	c
,	c
,	c
walking	c
in	c
the	c
clouds	c
,	c
,	c
you	c

Choosing	c
gave	c
me	c
such	c
big	c
pleasure	c
because	c
I	c
never	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
from	c
vere	c
do	c
I	c
take	c
money	c
for	c
my	c
wishes	c
.	c

It	c
all	c
comes	c
from	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

All	c
I	c
ought	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
buy	c
and	c
choose	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
,	c
,	c
having	c
is	c
a	c
dream	c
''	c
of	c
all	c
of	c

It	c
's	c
hard	c
for	c
me	c
even	c
to	c
emagine	c
the	i
situation	c
when	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Probably	c
it	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
moments	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
something	c
baddly	c
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
have	c
it	c
.	c

Another	c
situation	c
is	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
somebody	c
a	c
present	c
.	c

Everybody	c
know	c
that	c
,	c
,	c
present	c
presents	c
a	c
problem	c
''	c
You	c
know	c
your	c
own	c
task	c
but	c
what	c
vith	c
a	c
task	c
of	c
the	c
other	c
person	c
?	c

However	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
agree	c
with	c
opinion	c
that	c
,	c
,	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
''	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
everybody	c
like	c
to	c
buy	c
but	c
not	c
everybody	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
pleasure	c
in	c
it	c
.	c
