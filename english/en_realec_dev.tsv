Under	c
these	c
circumstances	c
,	c
will	i
a	c
worker	c
deal	i
with	c
the	c
tasks	c
with	c
success	c
and	c
avoid	c
high	c
stress	c
levels	c
.	c

Overall	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
why	c
people	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
public	c
libraries	c
is	c
to	c
borrow	c

When	c
we	c
speak	c
about	c
these	c
kind	c
of	c
things	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
remeber	i
to	c
listen	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
way	c
to	c
have	c
enough	c
sources	c
for	c
all	c
humans	c
is	c
to	c
trade	c
with	c
other	c
countries	c
and	c
to	c
import	c

Society	c
problems	c
should	c
be	c
solved	c
before	c

would	c
not	c
be	c

In	c

also	c
has	c
a	c
trend	c
to	c
decrease	c
by	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
its	c
users	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
modern	c
songs	c
have	c
ideas	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
luxary	i

it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
spend	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
online	c
websites	c
which	c
force	i
young	c
people	c
make	i

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
health	c
and	c
interest	c
to	c
sport	c
is	c
very	c
individual	c
to	c
every	c
person	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
disagree	c
that	c
they	c
can	c
given	i
freedom	c
of	c
his	i
feels	c
and	c
indeas	i
always	c
and	c
as	c

It	c
can	c
not	c
be	c
denied	c
that	c
nowadays	c
big	c
international	c
companies	c
replace	c
the	c
vast	c
majority	c
of	c
local	c

Sport	c
can	c
not	c
fix	c
problems	c
caused	c

However	c
,	c
only	c
56	c

of	c
people	c
,	i
who	c
is	c
older	c
than	c
65	c

,	c

I	c
agree	c
with	c
the	c
idea	c
that	c
connects	i
with	i
the	c
punishing	c
of	i

Looking	c
more	c
closely	c
at	c
the	c
trend	c
for	c
1979	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
,	c
that	c

not	c

As	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
from	c
chart	i
the	i
Worldwide	i

rate	c
remained	c
stable	c
with	c
5,9	c

A	c
variety	c
of	c
different	c
researches	c
had	c
given	c
some	c
results	c

and	c
now	c
specialists	c
explain	c
the	c
reasons	c
of	c
bad	c
behaviour	c
in	i
next	i
ways	i
(	c
which	c
,	c
I	c
agree	c
with	c
):	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
they	c
say	c
,	c
hooligans	c
are	c
victims	c
of	c
their	c
personal	c
problems	c
-	c
being	c
heartbroken	c

Some	c

are	c
dominated	c
but	i
the	c
males	i
on	i
a	c
20:1	i
ratio	c
,	i
while	c
on	i
some	i
school	i
teaching	i
studies	i
faculties	i
there	c
are	c
no	c
males	i
at	i
all	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
the	i
society	c
should	c
change	c
ideals	i
that	c
are	c
dictated	c
by	c
the	c
media	c
-	c
from	c
money	c
,	c
superficial	c
beauty	c
,	c
luxury	c
life	c
to	c
love	c

truly	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
at	c
these	c
matches	c
person	i
can	c
find	c
his	c

her	c
soulmate	c
and	c
become	c
friends	c

It	c
goes	c
without	c
saying	c
,	c
that	c
using	c
of	i
modern	c
technology	i
cause	c

problems	c
oy	i

,	c
both	c
in	c
psychological	c
and	c
physical	c
activity	c

It	c
is	c
unrepeatable	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
government	i
do	c
not	i
should	c
restrict	i
creative	c
people	c
hard	i
but	c
should	i
watching	i
and	c

Overall	c

in	c

talanted	i
people	c
who	c

There	c
are	c
two	c
majour	i
opinions	c
in	c
this	c
discussion	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
let	c
us	c
describe	c
the	c
situation	c
in	c
general	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
claim	c
,	c
that	c
sport	c
would	c
solve	c
all	c
the	c
problems	c
,	c
but	c
others	c
insist	c
on	c
different	c
methods	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
example	c
for	c
all	c
people	c
to	c
express	c
their	c
own	c
opinion	c
and	c
the	c
pluralism	c
of	c
opinions	c
and	c
ideas	c
will	c
lead	c
to	c
real	c
democratic	c
state	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
first	c
type	c
of	c
diploma	c
\"	c
skilled	c
vocational	c
\"	c
more	c
than	c
90	c
%	c
exist	c
males	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
citizen	i
from	c
the	i
East	i
European	i
's	i
country	i
has	c
a	c
salary	c
only	i
150	i
or	i
200	i
dollars	c
per	c
months	i
.	c

The	c
dots	c
are	c
building	c
a	c
curve	c
,	i
that	c
show	c
temperature	c
change	c
during	c
the	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
equally	c
important	c
aspect	c
is	c
that	c
unpaid	c
services	c
give	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
understand	c
that	c
money	c
is	c
not	c
the	c
only	c
reason	c
for	c
working	c
.	c

Let	c
's	c
speak	c
about	c
some	c
regions	c
.	c

This	c
brings	c
another	c
arguement	i
which	c
is	c
also	c
about	c
the	c
cost	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
the	c
charts	c
show	c
that	c
the	c
ages	i
of	i
the	c
populations	c
can	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
past	i
,	c
present	c
and	c
future	c
time	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
the	c
amount	i
of	c
female	c
and	c
male	c
school	c
graduants	i
enterening	c
universities	c
are	i
not	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

For	c
this	c
reason	c
making	c
groups	c
of	c
the	c
same	c
amount	c
of	c
young	c
men	c
and	c
women	c
can	c
turn	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
extreamly	i
hard	c
and	c
highly	c
unlikely	c
to	c
be	c
realised	c
.	c

Futhermore	i
,	c
a	c
person	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
workoholic	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
to	c
express	c
himself	c
through	i
his	c
work	i
.	c

As	c
regards	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
rules	c
and	c
restrictions	c
kill	c
creativity	c
and	c
in	c
this	c
essay	c
I	c
will	c
explain	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
using	c
some	c
examples	c
from	c
life	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
it	c
shows	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
audience	c
of	c
Instagram	c
are	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
what	c
everyone	c
should	c
get	c
from	c
democratic	c
society	c
and	c
government	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
the	c
railways	c
and	c
trains	c
are	c
used	c
to	c
deliver	c
machinery	c
goods	c
.	c

The	c
percentage	c
decreased	c
from	c
11	c
%	c
to	c
9,6	c
%	c
in	c
Middle	c
East	c
and	c
from	c
6,8	c
%	c
to	c
5,8	c
%	c
in	c
Latin	c
America	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
there	c
is	i
any	c
tendentions	c
.	c

Overall	c
,	c
there	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
that	c
the	c
highest	c
amount	c
of	c
billon	i
US	c
Dollars	c
were	c
spent	c
on	c
printed	c
books	c
in	c
2014	c
(	c
10,5	c
)	c
in	c
USA	c
,	c
whereas	c
the	c
lowest	c
of	c
all	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
were	c
spent	c
in	c
China	c
on	c
eBooks	c
in	c

Goverman	i
regulation	c
provide	c
many	c
different	c
types	c
of	c
problems	c
for	c
economy	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
in	c
markets	c
should	c
be	c
opened	c
and	c
free	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
necessary	c
to	c
banned	i
such	c
sportsmen	c
from	c
competing	c
not	c
only	c
for	c
2	c
or	c
3	c
years	c
,	c
but	c
for	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
life	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
it	c
began	c
to	c
rise	c
up	c
to	c
2040	c
,	c
when	c
it	c
hitted	i
the	c
peak	c
and	c
equaled	i
nearly	c
23	c
%	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
obviously	c
that	c
percentage	c
of	c
each	c
diploma	c
was	c
really	c
changable	i
in	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
male	c
indicator	c
of	c
education	c
was	c
higher	c
in	c
1999	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
pirates	c
and	c
their	c
clients	c
has	c
been	c
consistently	c
rising	c
.	c

It	c
means	c
that	c
unemployment	c
is	c
a	c
global	c
problem	c
which	c
should	c
be	c
solved	c
.	c

The	c
same	c
decrease	c
is	c
predicted	c
in	i
Yemen	c
:	c
the	c
percentage	c
fall	c
from	c
50,1	c
%	c
to	c
37,0	c
%	c
.	c

When	c
these	c
situations	c
happen	c
in	c
one	c
country	c
,	c
others	c
begin	i
to	c
help	c
one	i
,	c
to	c
send	i
the	c
first	c
aid	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
because	c
one	c
can	i
not	c
fix	c
the	c
situation	c
itself	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
second	c
chart	c
the	i
most	c
women	c
thought	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
for	c
using	c

is	i
ability	c

preffer	i

For	c
example	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
prove	c
differences	c
of	c
the	c
way	c
we	c
think	c

But	c
many	c
people	c
wonder	c
whether	c
it	c
is	c
safe	c
for	c
our	c
health	c
to	c
use	c
so	c
much	c
technologies	c
every	c
day	c

and	c
it	c
is	c
thought	c
by	c
some	c
people	c
that	c
using	c
modern	c
technologies	c
causes	c
huge	i
amount	c
of	c
health	c
problems	c
,	c
and	c
in	c
this	c
essay	c
I	c
will	c
try	c
to	c
It	c
is	c
common	c
knowledge	c
that	c
computers	c
are	c
unsubstitutional	i
in	c
work	c
and	c
everyday	c
life	c
nowadays	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
seems	c
that	c
this	c
measure	c
will	c
work	c
only	c
if	c
the	c
sportsmen	c
really	c
appologise	i
for	c
his	c
action	c
.	c

The	c
highest	c
point	c
is	i
reached	c
in	c
USA	i
with	c
10.5	c
billion	c
dollars	c
and	c
the	c
lowest	c
in	i
UK	c
with	c
2.6	c

The	c
first	c
line	c
of	c
the	c

gives	c
us	c
information	c
about	c
the	c

about	c
the	c
minimum	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
the	c
everage	i
grads	i
are	c
almost	c
equal	c
in	c
Rio	c

but	c
there	c
is	c
big	c
fluctuating	c
in	c

Many	c
people	c
argue	c
that	c
copying	c
and	c
sharing	c
these	c
files	c
should	c
be	c
punished	c

However	c
,	c
others	c
ca	c
n't	c
live	c
without	c

It	c
is	c
clear	c
from	c
the	c

that	c

more	c

In	c
1990	c
visitors	i
who	c
used	c
library	i
to	c
read	c
a	c
magazine	c
or	c
newspaper	c
was	c
approximately	c
a	c
sixth	c
part	c
of	c
all	c
people	i
coming	c
to	c
a	c
library	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
2000	c
this	c
number	c
decreased	c
in	i
3	i
times	i
and	c
just	i
a	c
tenth	c
of	c
all	c
visitors	i
prefered	i
to	c
use	c
library	i
for	c
this	c
purpose	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
since	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
people	c
willing	c
to	c
travel	c
increases	c
every	c
year	c
,	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
aircompaies	i
and	c
airplanes	c
they	c
provide	c
increases	c
respectively	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
It	i
is	c
too	c
difficult	c
to	c
find	c
The	c
Big	c
Bang	c
theory	c
in	c
Russian	c

and	c
also	c
in	c
our	c
language	c

The	c
overall	c
trauds	i
about	c
these	c
countries	c
are	c
different	c
.	c

Government	i
allocates	c
significant	c
sums	c
on	c
building	c
new	c

and	c
another	i
places	c
to	c

More	c
people	c
will	c
want	c
to	c

if	c
they	c

Speaking	i
about	i
children	c
who	c
did	c
regular	c
exercises	c
,	c
the	c
percentage	c
of	c
boys	c
was	c
higher	c
than	c
the	i
percentage	i
of	c

in	c
both	c
years	c
(	c
57	c
%	c
in	c
1990	c
and	c
87	c
%	c
in	c
2005	c
)	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
way	c
more	c
attractive	c
than	c
living	c
not	c
longer	c
than	c
40	c
years	c
because	c
of	c
a	c
heart	c

In	c
2014	c

USA	i

it	c
composed	i

for	c
the	c
printing	i
and	c
5,5	i
billions	c
US	c
dollars	c
for	c
the	c
eBook	c
.	c

Overall	i
it	c
is	c
evident	c
that	c
every	c
social	c
network	c
has	c
its	c
own	c
supporters	c
in	c
every	c
age	c
group	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
different	c
percentage	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
way	i
to	c
present	c
their	c
ideas	c
to	c
people	i
.	c

To	c
summurise	i
,	c
we	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
information	c
about	c
numbers	c
of	c
white	c
and	c
non0white	i
people	c
in	c
both	c
countries	c
are	c
diffrent	i
.	c

However	i
30	c
%	c
of	c
women	c
had	c
this	c
qualification	c
.	c

Parents	c
and	c
teachers	c
should	c
limit	c
children	c
's	c
using	i
od	i
gadgets	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
bad	c
for	c
their	c
mind	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
two	c
options	c
:	c
to	c
be	c
open	c
,	c
friendly	i
and	c
helpful	c
or	c
to	c
be	c
strict	c
,	c
self	c
-	c
sufficient	c
and	i
unwelcome	c
for	i
others	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
an	c
increase	c
in	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
free	c
services	c
for	c
eye	c
chaking	i
,	c
for	c
instance	c
,	c
may	c
help	c
to	c
recognise	c
and	c
prevent	c
such	c
problems	c
.	c

A	c
good	c
example	c
is	c
old	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
visiting	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
doctors	c
nowadays	c
because	c
they	c
had	c
not	c
had	c
time	c
for	i
caring	c
for	c
themselves	c
beacause	i
they	c
were	c
busy	c
working	c
.	c

First	c
and	c
foremost	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
prominant	i
to	c
mention	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
three	c
different	c
dominant	c
age	c
groups	c
in	c
these	c
courses(18	c
-	c
25	c
years	i
olds	i
in	c
science	c
,	c
40	c
and	c
above	c
in	c
arts	c
and	c
26	c
-	c
40	c
years	i
old	i
in	c
sports	c
and	c
health	c
)	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
evident	c
that	c
such	c
copying	c
of	c
information	c
is	c
illegal	i
activity	c
as	c
people	c
who	c
produce	c
all	c
this	c
music	c
and	c
films	c
have	i
great	i
harm	i
.	c

It	c
happens	c
because	c
they	c
grow	i
only	c
in	i
certain	c
areas	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
not	i
only	i
one	i
person	c
do	c
not	c
go	i
in	i
hospital	c
with	i
bad	c
look	i
.	c

Thus	i
permission	c
to	c
express	c
ideas	c
in	c
any	c
way	i
creators	c
wish	c
will	c
make	c
their	c
life	c
better	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
government	c
should	c
not	c
help	c
all	c
of	c
the	c
countries	c
,	c
while	c
others	c
argue	c
that	c
the	c
government	c
should	c
do	c
everything	c
for	c
the	c
peace	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
totally	c
disagree	c
with	c
this	c
opinion	c
and	c
in	c
this	c
essay	c
I	c
will	c
support	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
with	c
examples	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
clearly	c
seen	c
that	c
the	c
biggest	c
percentage	c
of	c
unemployment	c
was	c
in	c
countries	c
of	c
North	c
America	c
,	c
while	c
in	c
South	c
Asia	c
it	c
had	c
minimal	c
figures	c
.	c

Each	c
of	c
us	c
sometimes	c
ask	i
a	c
question	c
by	c
yourself	c
:	c
is	c
there	c
limit	c
in	c
my	c
freedom	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
personal	c
beliefs	c
and	c
ideas	c
?	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
important	c
conseqence	i
is	c
that	c
the	c
economy	c
of	c
your	i
country	c
will	c
be	c
stable	c
.	c

From	c
this	c
graph	c
,	c
one	c
can	c
conclude	c
that	c
Facebook	c
has	c
more	c
adult	c
users	c
overall	c
than	c
Instagram	c
or	c
LinkedIn	c
.	c

Personally	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
unhappines	i
of	c
people	c
with	c
it	c
and	c
their	c
possible	c
reaction	c

The	c
charts	c
below	c
presents	i
the	c
comparison	c
between	c
Europe	i
and	c
Asian	i
countries	c
,	c
Italy	c
and	c
YEMEN	c
,	c
concerning	c
of	i
expected	c
changes	c
in	c
the	c
ages	c
of	c
population	i
since	c
2000	c
up	c
to	c
2050	c

The	c
given	c
bar	c
chart	c
shows	c
us	c
the	c
numbers	c
of	c
unemployment	c
rate	c
in	c
different	c

all	c
over	c
the	c

during	c
two	c

Upon	i
the	c

So	c
,	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
male	c
and	c
female	c
students	c
in	c
your	c
group	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
last	c
thing	c
you	c
will	c
think	c
about	c
in	c
this	c
situation	c
.	c

The	c
government	c
has	c
to	c
try	c
decreasing	c
number	c
of	c
these	c
kind	c
of	c
factories	c
,	i
or	c
use	c
alternative	c
ways	c
of	c
energy	c
and	c
working	c
with	c
metal	c
.	c

That	c
may	c
solve	c
some	c
urgent	c
problems	c
.	c

The	c
figures	c
from	c
the	c
table	c
has	i
also	i
risen	i
significantly	c
.	c

Although	c
sometimes	c
they	c
can	c
hurt	c
us	c
in	c
some	c
ways	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
not	c
refuse	c
from	i
their	c
usage	c
.	c

As	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
from	c
the	c
charts	c
below	c
the	i
trends	c
for	c
transportation	c
by	c
rail	c
and	c
by	c
road	c
are	c
quite	c
different	c
.	c

The	c
decreasing	c
unemployment	c
in	c
latin	i
America	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
base	i
for	c
this	c
region	c
as	c
a	c
unit	c
of	c
developing	c
countries	c
.	c

Banning	c
them	c
for	c
some	c
time	c
may	c
help	c
them	c
to	i
realize	c
what	c
they	c
can	c
actually	c
lose	c
if	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
stop	c
their	c
illegal	c
actions	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
technologies	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
take	i
new	c
knowledges	c
and	c
educate	c
people	c
more	c
quickly	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
can	c
make	i
determination	c
affect	c
for	i
a	c
human	c
health	i
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
if	c
a	c
person	c
is	c
always	c
concentrated	c
on	c
screen	i
of	c
his	c
/	c
her	c
phone	c
,	c
eyes	i
suffer	c
,	c
eyesight	i
becomes	c
much	c
weaker	c

The	c
second	c

postgraduate	i
diploma	c
,	c
it	c
has	c
30	c
percent	c
less	c
than	c
skilled	c
vocational	i
.	i

So	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
considered	c
that	c
maybe	c
the	c
authorities	c
of	c
different	c
countries	c
should	c
narrow	c
their	c
focus	c
from	c
all	c
the	c

to	c
a	c
single	c

In	i

Mordern	i

Every	i

we	i
listen	i
the	c

As	i
a	i
result	c
of	c
these	c
measures	c
,	c
level	c
of	c
knowledge	c
is	c
likely	c
to	c
increase	c

as	c
well	c
as	c
enthusiasm	c

which	c
is	c

all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
obvious	c
that	c
nowadays	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
are	c
concerned	c
about	c
health	c
problems	c
and	c
diseases	c
which	c
are	c
caused	c
by	c
drammatical	i
raise	c
of	c

In	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
the	c
causes	c
lie	c
in	c
the	c
incessant	c
flow	c
of	c
violence	c
from	c

and	c
movies	c
which	c
trigger	c
the	c
desire	c
to	c
try	c
this	c
in	c
real	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	i
'd	i
like	c
to	c
add	c
,	i
that	c
people	c
should	c
n't	i
afraid	i
of	c
cooperation	c
of	c
countries	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
always	c
good	c
to	c
have	c
close	c
and	c
kind	c
relationships	c
.	c

These	c
theories	c
could	c
be	c
different	c
,	c
but	c
finally	i
aim	c
is	c
to	c
understand	c
what	c
might	c
we	c
do	c
to	c
provide	c
some	c
benefits	c
on	c
the	c
difficult	c
way	c
of	c
child	c
's	c
development	c
,	c
to	c
give	c
our	c
children	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
senses	c
and	c
features	c
in	c
the	c
life	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
they	c
do	c
not	c
do	c
their	c
homework	c
properly	c
and	c
rely	c
on	c
reading	c
the	c
materials	c
in	c
class	c
while	c
the	c
teachers	c
ask	c
them	c
.	c

To	c
my	c
mind	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
solution	i
of	i
this	c
problem	c
is	c
to	c
stand	c
a	c
specific	c
proportion	c
of	c
male	c
and	c
female	c
students	c
for	c
each	c
faculty	c
.	c

Other	c
countries	c
such	c
as	c
Turkey	c
,	c
Greece	c
and	c
USA	c
accounted	c
to	c
the	c
number	c
,	c
which	c
is	i
less	c
than	c
5	c
millions	i
of	c
UK	c
visitors	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
surprise	c
that	c
a	c
poor	c
person	c
may	c
steal	c
someone	c
's	c
wallet	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
food	c
for	c
himself	c
or	c
for	c
his	c
familly	i
.	c

Manufactured	c
goods	c
transportation	i
is	c
only	c
2	c
%	c
less	c
then	c
the	c
transportation	c
of	c
food	c
products	c
.	c

Although	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
remember	c
that	c
the	c
risk	c
of	c
traumas	c
and	c
injuries	c
is	i
also	c
exist	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
mentioned	c
that	c
the	c
tendency	c
of	c
an	i
explending	i
intercultural	i
communication	c
only	c
countinues	i
to	c
grow	c
rapidly	c
,	c
so	c
the	c
decision	c
of	i
being	i
separated	c
will	c
make	c
us	c
through	i
away	c
what	c
we	c
have	c
already	c
gaind	i
,	c
so	c
it	c
will	c
not	c
help	c
nor	i
the	i
country	i
itself	i
neither	c
the	c
world	i
order	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
others	c
consider	c
that	c
other	c
attempts	c
to	c
increase	c
public	c
health	c
are	c
needed	c
.	c

In	c
Germany	c
the	c
tendency	c
to	c
print	c
books	c
will	c
not	c
change	c
in	c
future	c

But	c
in	c

it	i

you	c

The	c

The	c
solution	c
for	c
this	c
problem	c
may	c
be	c
restricting	c

However	c

there	c
is	c

It	c
is	c
all	c
about	c
the	c

when	c
you	c

,	i
only	i

Also	c
,	c
in	i
my	i
view	i
,	c
I	c
absolute	i
disagree	c
with	c

It	c
is	c

it	c
will	c
feel	c
gratitude	c

pay	c

that	i
can	c
not	c

In	c

I	c

to	c
say	c
that	c
British	c

are	c
more	c

in	c
the	c

they	c

it	c
is	c
so	c

due	c
to	c

our	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
the	c
government	c
should	c
allow	c

as	c
there	c
are	c
many	c

It	c
is	c

On	c
the	c
one	c

every	c

The	c

of	c

and	c
it	c
is	c
about	c
70	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
support	c
and	c
develop	c
culture	c
of	c
each	c
country	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
all	c
three	c
trends	c
went	c
up	c
and	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
people	c
aged	c
65	c
and	c
over	c
became	c
the	c
biggest	c
among	c
the	c
Japanese	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
issue	c
of	c
punishment	c
for	c
taking	c
illegal	c
drugs	c
is	c
rather	c
controversial	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
not	c

that	c
there	c
will	c

To	c
summerize	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
important	i
problem	c
of	c
our	c

that	c

a	c

that	c

cause	c

and	c
should	c

It	c
can	c
create	c
some	c
problem	c
with	c

When	c
such	c
appaling	i

As	c
research	c
shows	c
the	i

Both	c
the	c

dramatic	i
shortening	c

Finally	c
,	c
in	c
1984	c
India	c
and	c
sweden	i
gained	c
the	c
same	c
percentage	c
of	c
energy	c
collected	c
from	c

representing	i
almost	c
45	c
%	c
,	c
nevertheless	c
then	c
Sweden	c
's	c
rates	c
were	i
declining	i
,	c
whereas	c
Indian	i
's	c
ones	c
grew	c
steadily	c
.	c

Due	c
to	c
this	c
fact	c
it	c
may	c
be	c
recommended	c
to	i
the	c
architects	c
to	c
pay	c
enough	c
attention	c
on	c
planning	c
how	c
the	c
bulding	i
will	c
look	c
like	c
in	c
the	c

Secondly	c
,	c
nowadays	c
large	c
part	c
of	c

are	i
getting	c
from	c
nuclear	c

electro	c
stations	c
,	c
although	c
Chernobyl	c
and	c
Fukusima	c
tragedies	c
demonstrated	c
the	c
instability	c
and	c
dangerous	c
of	c
this	c
way	c
getting	c
energy	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
generally	c
believed	c
that	c
architects	c
must	c
make	c
a	c
project	c
of	c
beautiful	c
,	c
breathtaking	c
buildings	c
.	c

I	c
partly	c
agree	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
governments	c
should	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
international	c
cooperation	c
and	c
development	c
of	c
all	c
spheres	c
.	c

Everybody	c
knows	c
that	c
healthy	c
food	c
,	i
right	c
food	c

influence	c
our	c

work	c
properly	c
,	c
so	c
,	c
this	c
issue	c
has	c
a	c
really	c
important	c
character	c
and	c
should	c
be	c
solved	c
on	c
the	c
state	c
level	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
a	c
conservative	c
government	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
likely	c
to	c
provide	c
a	i
research	c
concerning	c
the	c
issues	c
of	c
gender	c
or	c
sexuality	c

a	c
sufficient	c

gradually	c

I	c
completely	c
disagree	c
with	c
such	c
position	c

because	c
I	c
believe	c
in	c
a	c
global	c

where	c
people	c
take	c
responsibility	c
for	c
each	c
other	c
despite	c

Thus	c
,	c
the	c
opponents	c
of	c
this	c
opinion	c
disagree	c
saying	c
that	c
material	c
things	c
are	c
less	c
important	c
for	c
them	c
and	c
their	c
lifestyle	c
does	c
not	c

There	c
is	c
no	c

that	c

Overall	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c

in	c

all	c

enormous	c
level	i

but	c
in	c
2040	c
this	c

is	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
really	c
high	c

Contrastly	i
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	i
lot	i
of	i
people	c
that	c
are	i
not	c
love	c

so	c
they	c
can	c
decide	c
not	c
to	c

only	c
because	c
the	c
architects	c
,	c
who	c

the	c

significantly	c
higher	c

that	c

Secondly	c

In	c

only	c
in	c

a	c

It	c

that	c

and	i
this	c
is	c
involve	c
on	c

this	c

a	c

In	c

This	c
information	c
should	c
be	c
a	c
widespread	i
fact	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
striking	c
feature	i
of	c
this	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
due	c
to	c
modern	c
technologies	c
our	c
life	c
became	i
conviniet	i
:	c
many	c
people	c
can	c
not	c
reject	c
these	c
items	c
even	c
if	c
gadjet	i
are	c
harmful	c
because	c
as	c
without	c
them	c
they	c
will	c
spend	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
for	i
their	c
duties	i
,	c
for	c
a	c
example	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
type	c
of	c
crime	c
.	c

More	c
than	c
that	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
noticible	i
features	c
of	c
the	c
pie	c
charts	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
percentage	c
of	c
manufactured	c
goods	c
is	c
almost	c
equal	c
and	c
the	c
difference	c
make	c
up	c
only	c
3	c
%	c
.	c

Many	c
people	c
claim	c
that	c
this	c
money	c
would	i
better	c
be	c
spent	c
on	c
some	c
social	c
issues	c
(	c
such	c

The	c

three	c
different	c
countries	c

Japan	c

Therefore	c
,	c
people	c
need	c
to	c

their	i
help	c
in	i
order	c
to	c
survive	c
on	c

Beautiful	c

a	c

which	c
are	c

Looking	c
more	c
precisely	c
,	c
USA	c

the	c

Similar	i
development	c
may	c
be	c
observed	c

A	i
closer	i
look	i
at	i
the	i
graph	i
reveals	i
that	i
to	i
carry	i
out	i
this	i
evaluation	i
it	c
is	c
better	c
to	c
look	c
at	c
paired	c
cases	c
because	c
some	c
countries	c
showed	c
sillilar	i
pattern	c
during	c
this	c
15	c
year	c
period	c
:	c
Germany	c
and	c
New	c
Zeland	i
,	c
Great	c
Britain	i
and	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
determine	c
our	c
genetics	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
hard	c
to	c
improve	c
ecological	c
situation	c
,	c
but	c
undoubtfully	i
we	c
can	c
monitor	c
what	c
we	c
consume	c
.	c

The	c
absence	c
of	c
free	c
time	c
makes	c
them	c
miserable	c
,	c
longing	i
for	c
change	i
that	c
they	c
are	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
have	c

For	c

In	c
both	c
years	c
South	c
Asia	c
fluctuated	c
around	c
the	c
level	c
of	c
3,9	c
%	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
precise	c
,	c
it	c
means	c
that	c
some	c
people	c
do	c
work	c
and	c
earn	c
money	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
,	c
to	c
follow	c
the	c
expectations	c
of	c
their	c
parents	c
,	i
it	c
is	c
worth	c
saying	c
that	c
this	c
phenomenon	c
usually	c
roots	i
into	i
the	c
moments	c
of	c
bringing	c
up	c
,	c
when	c
parents	c
used	c
to	c
force	c
to	c
work	c
harder	c
and	c
to	c
achieve	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
goals	c
,	c
or	c
to	c
follow	c
their	c
own	c
dreams	c
about	c
buying	c
and	c
building	c
their	c
own	c
house	c
with	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
they	c
have	i
been	c
dreaming	c
before	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
sometimes	c
students	c
in	c
schools	c
do	c
not	c
behave	c
appropriately	c
and	c
that	c
causes	c
much	i
problem	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
pirate	i
copies	c
led	c
to	c
different	i
producers	i
lose	i
their	i
benefits	c
every	i
year	c
.	c

In	c
brief	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
,	i
that	c
the	c
account	i
men	c
and	c
women	c
fulucate	i
for	c
all	c
post	c
-	c
school	c
qualifications	c
in	c
Australia	c
in	c
1999	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
advantages	i
and	i
disadvantages	c
,	i
as	c
well	c
.	i

For	c
example	c
,	c
Tor	c
is	c
an	c
effective	c
platform	c
for	c
buying	c
guns	c
,	c
distributing	c
drugs	c
and	i
etc	c
.	c

Its	c
audience	c
is	c
dominated	c
by	c
young	c
adults	c
aged	c
from	c
18	c
to	c
29	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
proportion	c
of	c
older	c
users	c
is	c
only	c
slightly	c
lower	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
found	c
many	c
arguments	c
about	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
a	c
balance	c
in	c
this	c
issue	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
mean	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
boy	c
or	c
a	c
girl	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
common	c
problem	c
is	c
a	c
headache	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
take	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
to	c
find	c
another	c
working	c
field	c
and	c
improve	c
some	c
skills	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
line	c
chart	c
,	c
the	c
highest	c
temperature	c
in	c
Yakutsk	c
is	c
about	c
25	c
°	c
C	c
.	c

I	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
opinion	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
give	c
my	c
reasons	c
why	c
.	c

I	c
disagree	c
whith	i
this	c
position	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
to	c
reconstruct	c
all	c
the	c
aspects	c
of	c
our	c
modern	c
life	c
without	c
using	c
as	c
much	c
technology	c
as	c
today	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
much	c
easier	c
to	c
make	c
technology	i
more	c
healthy	c
,	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
continue	c
to	c
develop	c
its	c
technical	c
characteristics	c
.	c

In	c
Sweden	c
the	c
number	i
of	c
people	i
in	c
1940	c
was	c
about	c
7	c
percent	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
decorations	c
made	c
with	c
flammable	c
materials	c
should	c
not	c
be	c
used	c
for	c
buildings	c
,	c
where	c
there	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
mentioned	c
that	c
internet	c
music	c
and	c
films	c
are	c
not	c
material	c
objects	c
and	c
sometimes	c
people	c
just	c
can	c
not	c
believe	c
that	c
they	c
should	c
pay	c
for	c
something	c
they	c
could	c
not	c
touch	c
.	c

More	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
claim	c
that	c
teenagers	c
have	c
become	c
more	c
cruel	c
than	c
ever	c
before	c
.	c

LinkedIn	c
shows	c
the	c
most	c
stable	c

22	c

31	c

Therefore	c
,	c
they	c
attempt	c
to	c
present	c
eco	c

that	c
might	c
prevent	c

Watching	c

,	c

all	c
of	c
these	c
help	c
children	c
to	c
understand	c
and	c
appreciate	c
nature	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
interesting	c
,	c
when	c
a	c
person	c
likes	c
copying	c
and	c
sharing	c
music	c
or	c
another	c
object	c
of	c
art	c
,	c
he	c
teaches	c
his	c
children	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
way	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
could	i
call	c
the	c
family	c
as	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
.	c

They	c
have	c
the	c
law	i
to	c
think	c
in	c
own	i
way	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
some	c
people	c
think	c
differently	c
.	c

People	c
mostly	c
choose	c
a	c
circle	c
then	i
we	c
ask	c
them	c
about	c
'	c
sexy	c
shape	c
'	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
's	i
a	c
reason	i
why	c
we	c
looking	i
at	c
them	c
and	c
getting	i
esthetic	i
happiness	c
.	c

The	c
defenders	c
of	c
this	c
opinion	c
argue	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
examples	c
when	c
a	c
kid	c
from	c
a	c
decent	c
family	c
develops	c
different	c
behaviourial	i
deviations	c
after	c
meeting	c
the	c
real	c
life	c
full	c
of	c
violence	c
and	c
unjustice	i
.	c

And	c
the	i
forbit	i
do	c
these	c
things	c
it	c
is	c
false	c
.	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
very	i
big	c
mistake	c
.	c

Others	c
argue	c
that	c
this	c
way	c
would	c
not	c
dramatically	c
change	c
the	c
situation	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
other	c
methods	c
to	c
solve	c
the	c
problem	c
.	c

Although	c
the	c
pomodoro	i
of	c
the	c
north	c
country	c
will	c
have	c
some	c
other	c
combination	c
useful	i
component	c
despite	c
same	c
consequences	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
where	c
is	c
the	c
pirate	c
or	c
legal	c

(	i
5,5	i

.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
plethora	c
of	c
advantages	c
to	c
this	c
situation	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
creative	c
artists	c
feel	c
pressure	c
from	c
government	c
and	c
society	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
ca	c
n't	c
do	c
new	c
things	c
and	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
main	c
aim	c
of	c
their	c

Meanwhile	c
in	c
poor	c
countries	c
children	c
and	c
adults	c
suffer	c
from	c
hunger	c
and	c
thirst	c
as	c
in	c
Africa	c
.	c

So	c
people	c
with	c
such	c
views	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
commit	c
a	c
crime	c
because	i

The	c
information	c
provided	c
illustrates	c
the	c
proportion	c
of	c
people	c
of	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
65	c
and	c
over	c
from	c
1940	c

2040	c
in	c
Japan	c
,	c
Sweden	c
,	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

It	c
may	c
be	c
explained	c
by	c
different	i
funccioning	i
of	c
this	c
network	c
.	c

The	c
average	c
temperatures	i
in	c
Rio	c
de	c

looks	c
stable	c
while	c
the	c
temperature	c
in	c
Yakutsk	c
during	c
the	c
year	c
was	i
fluctuated	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
the	c
least	c
,	c
argument	c
is	c
that	c
importing	c
and	c
exchanging	c
food	c
can	c
help	c
poor	c
countries	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
important	c
to	c
teach	c
children	c
from	c
early	c
childhood	c
the	c
cultural	c
traditions	c
which	c
are	c
translated	c
via	c
the	c
pieces	c
of	c

Soon	c
after	c
the	c
punishment	c
he	i
became	c
a	c
world	c

Today	c
there	c
are	c
a	c

people	c
who	c
prefer	c
junky	i
and	c
unhealthy	c
food	c
like	c
hamburgers	c
and	c
french	c
fries	c

Sometimes	c
people	c
who	c
make	c
films	c
in	c
Russia	c
just	c
take	c
these	i
money	c
from	c
government	i
for	c
their	c
own	c

and	c
their	c
films	c
appear	i
to	i

This	c
will	c
be	c
about	c
2,1	c

Another	c
significant	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
some	c
countries	c
face	c
an	c
immense	c
number	c
of	c
social	c
problems	c

I	c
am	c
inclined	c
to	c
think	c
that	c
distribution	i
of	i
pirate	c
copies	c
and	c
downloading	c
files	c
from	c
the	c
internet	c
instead	c
buying	i
should	c
be	c

This	c
is	c
their	c

another	i

When	c
a	c
student	c
learns	c
an	c
architechture	i
in	c
a	c
college	c
or	c
university	c
,	c
he	c
will	i

That	c
's	i
why	c
for	c
such	c
a	c

Russia	c

As	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
increasing	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c

may	c
be	c
just	c
one	c
of	c
tools	i

Some	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
those	c
who	c
have	c
a	c
creative	c
job	c
should	c
not	c
be	c
restricted	c
by	c
anyone	c
in	c
their	c
work	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
suppose	c
that	c
the	c
characteristics	c
we	c
are	c
born	c
with	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
influence	c
on	c
us	c
and	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

When	c
male	c
and	c
female	c
students	c
know	c
each	c
other	c
better	c
,	c
all	c
studying	c
projects	c
are	c
worth	c
doing	c
and	c
results	c
are	c
achievable	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
list	c
of	c
health	c
problems	c
caused	c
by	c
modern	c
technology	c
starts	c
with	c
the	c
lack	c
of	c
activity	c
.	c

The	c
diagramm	i
in	c
2014	c
is	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
in	c
2015	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
clearly	c
seen	c
from	c
the	c
charts	c
that	c
the	c
percentage	c
of	c
manufactured	c
goods	c
transported	c
by	c
rail	c
and	c
by	c
road	c
is	c
almost	c
equal	c
(	c
a	c
quarter	c
)	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
doubt	c
that	c
this	c
situation	c
may	c
be	c
repeated	c
after	c
the	c
limited	c
of	c
time	c
,	c
so	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
point	c
that	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
atheletes	i
should	c
be	c
banned	c
forever	c
.	c

The	c
highest	c
temperature	c
in	c
Yakutsk	c
is	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c

in	c
July	c
.	c

In	c
Yemen	c
the	c
percentage	c
of	c
middle	c
aged	c
persons	i
is	c
predicted	c
to	c
increase	c
per	i
10	c
%	c
and	c
become	c
more	c
than	c
a	c
half	c
of	c
the	c
whole	c
population	c
in	c
the	c
country	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
other	c
ways	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
more	c
effective	c
and	c
sucsessful	i
.	c

This	c
happened	c
with	c
a	c
Eurovision	c
compitetor	i
several	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
chart	c
displays	c
where	c
exactly	c
those	c
50	c
million	c
went	c

Among	c
the	i
30	i
-	c
49	i
year	c
old	c
people	c
facebook	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
prominent	c
social	c
network	c
and	i
it	c
is	c
used	c
by	c
73	c
percent	c
of	c
adults	c
.	c

Be	c
that	c
as	c
it	c
may	c
,	c
they	c
thinks	i
it	c
's	i
the	c
best	c
way	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
nowadays	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
eat	c
and	c
drink	c
differend	i
goods	c
from	c
other	c
countries	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
kike	i
to	c
say	c
that	c
of	i
course	c
implanting	i
of	c
different	c
sport	c
facilities	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
has	c
some	c
results	c
and	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
care	c
about	c
their	c
health	c
and	c
about	c
the	c
way	c
they	c
look	c
.	c

The	c
pie	c
charts	c
illustrate	c
the	c
information	c
on	c
quantity	i
of	c
students	c
of	c
different	c
ages	c
attending	c
Science	c
,	c
Arts	c
and	i
Sports	c
and	c
Health	c
courses	c
in	c
the	c
UK	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
take	c
a	c
brief	c
look	c
on	c
the	c
blocks	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
easily	c
say	c
,	i
that	c
situation	i
changes	c
mirrorable	i
after	c
the	c
cathegory	i
of	c
40	c
-	c
49	c
.	c

This	c
outlook	c
on	c
life	c
includes	c
a	c
huge	c
demand	i
on	c
what	c
their	c
child	c
will	c
do	c
in	c
future	i
and	c
how	c
he	c
will	i
live	c
in	c
the	i
community	i
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
can	c
solve	c
the	c
probrem	i
which	c
we	c
have	c
in	c
our	c
university	c
system	c
.	c

It	i
can	i
be	i
agreed	i
with	c
the	c
statement	c
about	c
getting	i
punishment	c
both	i
for	c
hackers	i
and	c
people	c
using	c
pirat	i
's	i
copies	c
.	c

But	c
after	c
2000	c
was	i
a	c
drammatically	i
increasing	c
from	c
5	c
procent	i
to	c
28	c
procent	i
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
important	c
to	c
deevote	i
the	c
free	c
time	c
for	i
personal	c
interests	c
,	c
self	c
-	c
development	c
,	c
family	c
members	c
and	c
friends	c
and	c
other	c
actifities	i
that	c
make	c
a	c
person	c
really	c
satisfied	c
and	c
content	i
in	i
their	c
live	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
male	c
and	c
female	c
students	c
should	c
obviously	c
depends	i
on	c
the	c
subject	c
which	c
school	c
graduaters	i
is	c
chosen	i
.	c

The	c
other	c
opinion	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
atleth	i
should	c
be	c
banned	c
from	c
competing	c
proffessionally	i
for	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
their	c
lives	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
are	i
some	c
decreasment	i
in	c
the	c
Middle	c
East	c
from	c
11	c
to	c
9,6	c
point	i
and	c
in	i
the	c
Latin	c
America	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
they	c
continue	c
to	c
work	c
as	c
hard	c
as	c
they	c
did	c
to	c
save	c
their	c
workplace	c
and	c
to	c
get	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
money	c
.	c

Overall	c
,	c
within	c
the	c
information	c
provided	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
said	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
hundred	c
years	c
the	c
proportion	c
of	c
population	c
65	c

and	c
older	c
in	c
Japan	c
,	c
Sweden	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
has	c
increased	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
sure	c
that	c
female	c
and	c
male	c
are	c
not	c
equal	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
dominant	c
age	c
group	c
varies	c
from	c
course	c
to	c
course	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
from	c
the	c

Overall	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
for	c

returning	c

it	c
was	c
about	c

in	c

whereas	c
the	c

reasons	c
were	c

But	c
unfortunately	c
underground	c

London	c
is	c
not	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
because	c

Meanwhile	c
other	c

poorer	c

of	c
all	c
every	i

So	c
it	i
's	i
wrong	c
to	c
stop	c
it	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
true	c
that	c
private	i
companies	c
invest	c
more	c
money	c
in	c
research	c
than	c
the	c
government	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
often	c
have	c
a	c
vested	c
interest	c
in	c
science	c
and	c
technologies	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
such	c
serious	c
problem	c
can	c
be	c
fixed	c
not	c
necessary	c
by	c
banning	c
and	c
ruining	c
career	c
of	c
good	c
sportsmen	c
but	c
through	c
serious	i
investigation	c
and	c
testing	c
that	c
will	c
help	c
to	c
prevent	c
such	c
things	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
rail	c
is	c
used	c
much	c
less	c
to	c

products	c
(	c

By	c

This	c

is	i
stable	c
in	c

However	c
in	c
Rio	c

this	c
difference	c
is	c
small	c

In	c
2000	c
Yemen	i
's	i

were	i
at	c

Italy	i
's	i
ones	i
are	c
remain	c
so	c
in	c
2050	c

But	c
the	c
situation	c
with	c
lack	c
of	c
discipline	c
can	c
be	c
changed	c
with	i
a	i
lot	i
of	i
ways	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
clear	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
coping	i
from	c
Internet	i
should	c
be	c
legalized	c
on	i
particular	c
level	c
.	c

Also	c
sportsmen	c
take	c
some	c
drugs	c
because	c
of	c
their	c
health	c
statement	c

Moreover	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c

The	c
level	c

who	c
held	c
a	c

is	i
more	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
forecasted	c

that	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
for	c
Germany	c
and	c
China	c
the	c

appeares	i
to	c
be	c
slightly	c
different	c

up	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
difference	c
in	c

In	c
the	c

The	c

not	c
the	c
expetion	i

the	c
following	c
suggestion	c
is	c
offered	c
:	c
should	c
Universities	c
accept	c
equal	c
numbers	c
of	c
male	c

female	c
students	c
in	c
every	c
subject	c

Such	c
problems	c
may	c
be	c
caused	c
by	c
various	c
situations	c
that	c
students	c
shave	i
to	c
face	c
and	c
we	c
should	c
somehow	c
solve	c
this	c
situation	c
with	c
bad	c
behaviour	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
perspective	c
,	c
It	i
is	c
quite	c
controversional	i
issue	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
Midde	i

I	c

it	i
is	c

from	c

It	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
increase	c
the	c
number	c

but	c
we	c
must	c
not	c

about	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
we	c
may	c
an	c
inference	c
,	i
that	c
unemployment	c

not	c

the	c

all	c

the	c

It	c

to	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
prefferece	i
to	c
get	c

and	i
Postgraduate	c

is	c
very	c
differentiated	c
betweeng	i

groups	c

while	c
preference	i

held	i

almost	c
the	c

In	c

it	i

also	c
predicted	c
that	c

but	c
not	c
in	c
so	i
huge	c
proportion	i

On	c
the	c

about	c
70	c

diploma	c

whereas	c
only	c
35	c

of	c
males	c
had	c
such	c
qualification	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
opinion	c
.	c

But	i
from	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
if	c
we	c
do	c
sport	c
it	i
does	c
not	c
mean	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
never	c
have	c
any	c
illneses	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
situations	c
when	c
the	c
usage	c
of	c
illegal	c
drugs	c
was	c
connected	c
with	c
the	c
cheating	c
,	c
should	c
not	c
be	c
forgotten	c
or	c
underestimated	c
as	c
in	c
this	c
case	c
it	c
is	c
irrespectable	i
to	c
other	c
athletes	c
who	c
train	c
and	c
do	c
not	c
break	c
the	c
rules	c
of	c
the	c
competitions	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
ongoing	c
debates	c
about	c
whether	c
or	c
not	c
exploring	c
the	i
space	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
to	c
spend	c
money	c
,	c
if	c
society	c
has	c
many	c
problems	c
of	c
its	c
own	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
poverty	c
is	c
still	c
a	c
very	c
big	c
issue	c
in	c
lots	c
of	c
countries	c
.	c

Their	c
fans	c
will	c
always	c
find	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
pay	c
them	c
for	c
work	c
.	c

If	c
some	c
Russian	c
film	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
always	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
plot	c
and	c
some	c
message	c
,	c
not	c
because	c
of	c
visual	c
effects	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
trully	i
believe	c
that	c
creative	c
artists	c
should	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
act	c
the	c
way	c
they	c
want	c
being	c
free	c
,	c
except	c
those	c
cases	c
which	c
could	c
harm	c
the	c
society	c
or	c
distabelise	i
it	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
population	c
of	c
country	c
might	c
be	c
so	c
different	c
.	c

The	c
pie	c
charts	c
illustrate	c
information	i
about	c
the	c
transportation	c
of	c

between	c
countries	c
in	c
Eastern	c
Europe	c
in	c
2008	c

The	c

the	c

So	i
,	i
very	i
often	i
parents	i
do	i
not	i
care	i
about	i
the	i
upbringing	i
and	i
teaching	i
of	i
the	i
child	i
.	c

People	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
should	c
take	c
some	c
measures	c
to	c
decrease	c
influence	i
of	c
gadgets	c
and	c
modern	c
technologies	c
on	c
their	c
health	c
by	c
using	c
high	c
quality	c
screens	c
and	c
monitors	c
and	c
doing	c
some	c
breaks	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
working	i
process	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
have	c
mentioned	c
Hollywood	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
not	c
also	c
forget	c
that	c
films	c
produced	c
there	c
cost	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

As	c
long	c
as	c
you	c
support	c
another	c
country	c
,	c
your	c
government	c
has	c
a	c
right	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
their	c
help	c
too	i
.	c

I	c
partely	i
agree	c
with	c
this	c
opinion	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
try	c
to	c
explain	c
my	c
possition	i
in	c
the	c
essay	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	c
people	c
should	c
bue	i
the	c
original	c

it	c
they	i
need	c
quality	c

Moreover	c
,	c
younsters	i
tend	c
to	c
use	c

less	c
frequently	c
than	c
older	c

.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
,	i
that	c
average	c
maximum	i
and	c
minimum	c
are	c
quite	c
similar	c
.	c

Only	c
6	c

After	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
80	c
-	c
s	c
it	c
became	i
grow	i
a	c
lot	i
and	c
reached	c
a	i
number	c
of	c
50	c
millions	i
by	c
1999	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
obvious	c
that	c
children	c
nowadays	c
spend	c
much	c
less	c
time	c
walking	c
outdoors	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
they	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

It	c
takes	c
less	c
time	c
,	c
what	c
really	c
makes	c
sense	c
in	c
case	c
someone	c
suddenly	c
decides	c
to	c
get	c
somwhere	i
quickly	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
maybe	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
reasons	c
of	c
such	c
a	c
crime	c
boom	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
reasons	c
stated	c
above	c
are	c
one	i
of	i
the	c
most	c
important	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
government	i
is	c
able	i
to	c
find	c
punishments	c
and	c
methods	c
of	c
pirate	c
's	c
identification	c
in	c
the	c
future	c

Turning	c

health	c

in	c
2005	c
in	c
comparison	c
to	c
1990	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
has	c
an	i
other	i
side	c
:	c
teenagers	c
often	c
want	i
catch	i
as	c
much	c
attention	c
as	c
they	c
could	i
and	c
this	c
may	c
lead	c
to	i
comitting	i
crimes	c
.	c

The	c
chart	c
and	c
table	i
illustrate	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
Canadian	c
females	c
and	c
males	c
suffering	c
from	c
obesity	c
between	c
1985	c

,	i
also	c
the	c
persentage	i
of	c

girls	c
who	c
did	c
regular	c
physical	c
activities	c
over	c

Moreover	c
,	c
if	c
biuldings	i
are	c
constructed	c
for	c
special	c
purpouses	i
,	c
architects	c
have	c
to	c
built	i
them	c
more	c
carefuly	i
and	c
provide	c
them	c
with	c
all	c
the	c
conditions	i
which	c
will	c
be	c
necessary	c
to	c
have	i
there	c
in	c
future	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
private	c
surveys	c
are	c
more	c
independent	i
as	c
they	c
are	c
not	c
aimed	c
at	c
disguising	c
the	c
real	c
situation	i
as	c
governments	c
often	c
do	c
.	c

Is	c
it	c
a	c
reason	i
to	i
make	i
the	c
same	c
nomber	i
of	c
men	c
and	c
women	c
on	i
the	c
faculties	c
in	c
the	c
universities	c
?	c

It	c
is	c
observable	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
significant	c
differences	c
.	c

A	c
myriad	c
of	c
people	c
advocate	c
the	c
view	c
that	c
private	c
companies	c
pay	c
more	c
attention	c
to	c
the	i
scientific	c
researchers	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
this	c
system	c
may	c
help	c
poor	c
people	c
,	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
destroy	c
economic	c
prosperity	c
.	c

Everyone	c
wants	c
to	c
be	c
cool	c
and	c
liked	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
often	c
listen	c
too	c
much	c
to	c
what	c
others	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
\"	i
Witcher	c
3	c
\"	c
from	i
\"	c
CD	c
-	c
Project	c
\"	c
had	c
the	c
biggest	c
sellers	i
after	c
2	c
month	i
of	c
release	i
,	c
maybe	c
it	c
will	i
effect	c
of	i
\"	c
white	c
pirates	c
\"	c
which	i
buy	c
this	c
game	c
after	c
one	c
-	c
two	c
month	i
of	c
gaming	i
on	c
pirate	c
copies	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
should	c
understand	c
that	c
this	c
person	c
put	c
his	c
soul	c
and	c
heart	c
into	c
his	c
creations	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
not	c
be	c
denyed	i
that	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
are	c
the	c
fans	c
of	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
sports	c
and	c
like	c
to	c
watch	c
sport	i
or	c
even	c
to	c
go	c
at	i
the	c
stadiums	c
.	c

And	c
Finally	i
,	c
shares	c
of	c
Instagram	c
users	c
in	c
every	c
age	c
group	c
are	i
plummeted	i
from	c
the	c
53	c
%	c
to	c
25	c
%	c
when	c
we	c
compare	c
different	c
groups	c
of	c
people	c
.	c
let	i
's	i
talk	c
about	c
similarities	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
of	c
importance	i
of	c
happiness	c
in	c
life	c
is	c
said	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
significant	c
.	c

The	c
person	c
,	i
who	c
cheated	c
once	c
,	i
is	c
not	c
likely	c
to	c
be	c
trusted	c
again	c
later	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
taking	c
all	c
the	c
arguments	c
into	c
account	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
still	c
consider	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
family	c
who	i
plays	c
the	c
biggest	c
part	c
in	c
a	i
child	c
's	c
development	c

inculcating	c
crucial	c
moral	c
principles	c
and	c

Also	c
,	c
they	c
work	c

,	c
to	c
provide	c
themselves	c
with	c
a	i
good	c
life	c
conditions	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
one	c
particular	c
way	c
to	c
make	c
public	c
health	c
better	c

Is	c
it	c
a	c
good	c
or	c
wrong	c
idea	c
?	c

That	c
means	c
the	c
tendency	i
of	i

probably	c
about	c

It	c

that	c

nowadays	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
it	c
may	c
be	c
easier	c
for	c
a	c

to	c
gain	c

So	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
considered	c
as	c
a	c
psychological	c

At	c

a	c

that	c
it	c

lead	c
to	c
globalization	c

that	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
for	c
world	c
's	c
population	c
and	c
conection	i
among	c
different	c
countries	c
and	c
their	c
governments	c
.	c

They	c
have	c
bad	i
land	c
and	i
it	c
leads	c
to	c
poor	c
economy	c
.	c

In	c
Middle	i
East	i
and	c
Latin	c
America	c
this	c
level	c
is	i
getting	i
lower	c
but	i
this	c
change	c
is	i
not	c
getting	c
bigger	c
than	c
two	c
percent	c
.	c

So	c
this	c
is	c
about	c
20	c
%	c
difference	c
.	c

We	c
recognise	c
these	c
rules	c
and	c
norms	c
behavior	i
in	c
result	c
of	c
our	c
experience	c
in	c
the	i
life	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
Indonesia	c
has	c
more	c
agricultiral	i
workers	c
because	c
of	c
it	i
's	i
location	c
,	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
who	c
provide	c
different	c
services	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
complietly	i
agree	c
that	c
if	c
we	c
give	c
artists	c
a	c
[	c
]	c
to	c
do	c
what	c
they	c
want	c
they	c
can	c
reach	c
our	c
culture	c
,	c
create	c
something	c
new	c
and	c
get	c
a	i
fame	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
for	c
them	c
and	c
their	c
own	c
country	c
,	c
family	c
and	c
nationality	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
important	c
what	c
characteristics	c
people	c
have	c
when	c
they	c
born	c
.	c

Why	c
do	c
people	c
commit	c
crimes	c
?	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
offices	c
in	c
China	c
which	i
role	c
is	c
to	c
be	c
not	c
as	c
hazardous	c
and	c
useless	c
for	c
the	i
nature	c
as	c
the	i
other	c
ones	c
which	c
only	i
spoil	c
everything	c
around	c
them	c
.	c

Both	c
of	c
my	c
parents	c
are	i
working	i
in	c
a	c
university	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
professors	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
obvious	c
,	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
have	c
good	c
abilities	c
in	c
science	c
,	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
people	c
around	c
influence	c
on	c
me	c
too	c
.	c

The	c
stated	c
based	c
on	c
ideas	c
of	c
liberty	c
and	c
respect	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
some	c
government	c
projects	c
may	c
be	c
presented	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
tell	c
all	c
people	c
how	c
important	c
this	c
problem	c
is	c
and	c
that	c
we	c
should	c
unite	c
together	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
solve	c
this	c
problem	c
.	c

Overall	c
,	c
in	c
both	c
countries	c
there	c
is	c
an	c
upward	c
trend	c
on	c
the	c
numbers	c
of	c
the	c
oldest	c
people	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
travelling	c
by	c
air	c
was	c
reduced	c
,	c
people	c
would	c
likely	c
use	c

Some	c
of	c
the	c
possible	c
solutions	c
to	c
this	c
problem	c
include	c
restricting	c
video	i
games	c
and	c
movies	c
and	c
promoting	c
lawful	c
behaviour	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
a	c
result	c
of	c
modern	c
tendency	c
.	c

Respectively	c
,	c
it	c
may	c
have	c
grave	c
aftermaths	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
totally	c
agree	c
with	c
the	c
sciencetists	i
,	c
because	c
human	c
takes	c
his	c
treats	c
of	c
character	c
from	c
the	c
structure	c
of	c
DNA	c
code	c
wchich	i
he	c
is	c
given	c
by	c
his	c
mother	c
and	c
father	c
.	c

This	c
essay	c
,	c
nevertheless	c
,	c
agrees	c
on	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
children	c
start	c
to	c
socialise	c
inside	c
the	c
family	c
and	c
are	c
given	c
all	c
the	c
behavioral	c
patterns	c
from	c
their	c
parents	c
and	c
siblings	c
.	c

Because	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
popular	c
and	c
interesting	c
to	c
visit	c
such	c
old	c
and	c
beautifull	i
stations	c
which	c
were	c
built	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
.	c

School	c
is	c
an	c
environment	c
where	c
a	i
child	c
creates	c
all	c
the	c
relationships	c
and	c
try	i
to	c
build	c
bonds	c
with	c
his	c
peers	i
,	i
which	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
expiriences	i
.	c

The	c
process	c
leads	c
to	c
misunderstanding	c
and	c
the	c
studying	c
process	c
becomes	c
worthless	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
statement	c
that	c
private	c
businessmen	c
spend	c
more	c
money	c
than	c
authorities	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
carry	c
out	c
researches	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
growing	i
number	c
of	c
gyms	c
will	c
attract	c
people	c
and	i
they	c
will	c
start	c
a	i
healthy	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
two	c
main	c
reasons	i
of	i
this	c
evidence	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
chart	c
includes	i
statistics	c
about	c
people	c
who	c
attend	c
sports	c
and	c
health	c
courses	c
.	c

Although	c
,	c
in	i
2018	i
this	c
market	c
will	c
increase	c
.	i

I	c
strongly	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
best	c
solution	c
is	c
to	c
make	c
children	c
spends	i
their	c
time	c
in	i
nature	i
as	c
much	c
as	c
possible	c
to	c
give	c
them	c
possibility	c
to	c
explore	c
and	c
appreciate	c
the	c
nature	c
.	c

The	c
chart	c
gives	c
the	i
information	c
about	c
the	c
change	i
in	c
the	c
rate	c
of	c
unemployment	c
in	c
five	c
world	c
regions	c
in	c
2014	c
and	c
2015	c
.	c

In	c
Australia	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
female	c
workers	c
outweight	i
the	c
figures	c
of	c
male	c
workers	c
,	c
while	c
in	c
Indonesia	c
services	c
is	i
more	c
preferable	c
for	c
men	c
rather	c
than	c
women	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
their	c
research	c
all	i
people	c
have	c
their	c
own	c
understandings	c
of	c
happiness	c
,	c
which	c
were	c
influenced	c
by	c
their	c
education	c
,	c
the	c
perception	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
and	c
cultural	i
background	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
no	c
doubt	c
,	i
that	c
government	c
restrictions	c
erode	c
genuine	c
creativity	c
and	c
make	c
current	c
art	c
biased	c
.	c

But	c
as	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
sagnifically	i
important	c
to	c
care	c
about	c
how	i
buildings	c
look	c
like	c
and	i
it	c
is	c
obvious	c
that	c
they	c
must	c
be	i
look	c
gorgeous	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
creative	c
artists	c
heve	i
not	c
to	c
irritate	c
citizens	c
and	c
other	c
ordinairy	i
people	c
,	c
because	c
if	c
people	c
will	c
not	c
support	c
them	c
it	c
make	c
no	c
sence	i
for	c
all	c
.	c

To	i
conclusion	i
,	c
the	c
younger	i
an	c
employee	c
the	i
more	c
support	c
he	c
may	c
get	c
from	c
the	c
employer	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c

we	c
will	c
have	c
products	c
and	c
goods	c
with	i
the	c
good	c
quality	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
always	c
read	c
instructions	c
from	c
creators	i
of	c
technology	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
know	c
all	c
possible	c
cases	i
and	c
the	c
ways	i
of	i
their	i
solving	i
.	c

There	c
is	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
underground	c
railway	c
systems	c
in	c
six	c
cities	c
in	c
the	c
table	c
below	c

The	c
second	c
place	c
is	i
for	c
Middle	i
East	i
,	c
where	c
the	c
rate	c
of	c
unemployment	c
is	i
only	c
1,5	c
%	c
less	c
.	c

This	c
essay	c
will	c
examine	c
both	c
benefits	c
and	c
drawbacks	c
of	c
this	c
notion	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
,	i
that	c
countries	c
should	c
share	c
their	c
unique	c
food	c
with	c
all	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Only	c
one	c
counry	i
has	c
fallen	i
unsignificantly	i
his	i
using	i
of	i
fossil	i
fuels	i
in	i
energy	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
people	c
who	c
believe	c
that	c
we	c
should	c
decrease	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
flights	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
protect	c
the	c
enviroment	i
.	c

And	c
finally	c
,	c
you	c
just	c
use	c
it	c
,	c
listening	c
it	i
or	c
watching	c
without	i
any	c
payment	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
first	c
chart	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
that	c
from	c
1979	c
to	c
1985	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
people	c
,	i
who	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
abroad	c
by	c
UK	c
residents	c
,	c
was	i
encreased	i
.	c

Looking	c
at	c
these	c
curves	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
climate	c
difference	c
for	c
differt	i
seasons	c
much	i
stronger	c
in	c
Yakutsk	c
,	c
where	c
gap	i
between	c
highest	i
and	c
smalles	i
numbers	c
above	i
60	c
degrees	c
.	c

I	c
definitely	c
suppose	c
that	c
increasing	c
sports	i
facilities	c
would	c
have	c
little	c
effect	c
of	c
public	c
health	c
.	c

Today	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
debate	c
among	c
architects	c
what	i
is	c
more	c
important	c
for	c
a	c
building	c
:	c
its	c
appearance	c
or	c
its	c
purpose	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
the	c
mankind	c
is	c
in	c
a	c
rather	c
hard	c
situation	c

This	c
is	i
the	c
cause	c

high	i

which	c
creates	c

conditions	c

the	c

The	c

All	c

this	c

About	i

I	i
read	c
on	i
the	i
last	c

In	c
our	c
modern	c
life	c
people	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problem	i
with	c
health	c

Moreover	c

From	c
1995	c

there	c
are	c
more	c

It	c
is	c
undeniable	c
that	c
this	c

should	c
be	c
a	c

starting	c

Winter	c
,	c
In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c

that	c

Firstly	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
governments	c
want	c
to	c
tackle	c
this	c
problem	c
they	c
should	c
apply	c
a	c
much	c
stricter	c
system	c
of	c
penalties	c
and	c
punishments	c
for	c
offending	c
crimes	c
and	c
also	c
for	c
the	c
useage	i
of	c
drugs	c
and	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
young	c
people	c
commit	c
crimes	c

,	c
first	c

all	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
controversial	c
issue	c
and	c
I	c
support	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
production	c
for	c
own	c
population	c
because	c
it	c
has	c
more	c
positive	c
sides	c

Firstly	i
it	c
is	c
the	c

of	c

A	c
holistic	c
view	c
at	c
the	c

with	c
information	c
that	c

should	c
also	c
encourage	c
young	i

to	c
build	c
a	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
from	c
the	c
bar	c

that	c
the	c
percentage	c
of	c

gradually	c
growing	c

Creating	c
something	c

a	c
difficult	c
way	c
to	c

what	c

It	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
understand	c
it	c
and	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
strong	c
clear	c
list	c
of	c
factors	c

which	c
are	c
important	c

that	c

is	c
that	c

In	c
this	c

will	c
try	c
to	c
analyse	c
this	c
case	c
in	c
terms	c
of	c
its	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c

These	c
two	c

are	c
very	c
different	c

The	c
second	c

shows	c
what	c
was	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
of	c
using	c
Facebook	c
for	c
men	c
and	c
women	c
.	c

(	c
From	c
2000	c
the	c
situation	c
changed	i
dramatically	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
,	i
in	c
that	c
case	c
it	c
is	c
better	c
when	c
private	c
companies	c
pay	c
for	c
research	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
way	c
to	c
stimulate	c
the	c
evolution	c
of	c

The	c
percentage	c
of	c
male	i

working	c
in	c

are	c
practically	c
equal	c
in	c
Indonesia	c
(	c
56	c
per	c

)	c
and	c
in	c
Australia	c
(	c
65	c
per	c

)	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
feature	c
of	c
two	c
pie	c
charts	c
are	i
that	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
method	c
of	c
transportation	c
metals	i
is	c
railways	c
,	c
whereas	c
food	c
products	c
are	i
delivered	c
by	c
autobahns	c
.	c

And	c
then	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
successful	c
process	c
.	c

Generally	c
speaking	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
a	c
tendency	c
that	c
young	c
people	c
old	c
prefer	c
to	c
participate	c
in	c
Science	c
courses	c
,	c
while	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
older	c
people	c
try	c
to	c
attend	c
Sports	c
and	c
Health	c
courses	c
and	i
,	c
besides	c
,	c
the	c
oldest	c
endeavour	i
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
Arts	c
courses	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
faculty	c
of	c
philology	c
there	c
are	c
too	c
many	c
girls	c
and	c
almost	c
no	c
boys	c
,	c
which	c
leads	c
to	c
many	c
conflicts	c
and	c
the	c
decreasing	c
of	c
knowledges	c
.	c

The	c
sport	c
gives	c
us	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
energy	c
and	c
positive	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
make	c
us	c
get	c
out	c
of	c
bed	c
early	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
noticable	i
,	c
that	c
all	c
qualifications	i
of	c
men	c
biggest	i
than	c
women	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
there	c
are	i
a	c
bigger	c
amount	c
of	c
non	c
-	c
white	c
population	c
.	c
who	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
prison	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
the	c
smallest	c
indicator	i
in	c
January	c
then	c
riched	i
a	c
pick	i
in	c
July	c
and	c
went	i
downward	c
in	c
December	c
and	c
compared	i
-	c
35	c
,	c
25	c
and	c
-	c
36	c
degrees	c
respectively	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
kids	c
do	c
not	c
get	c
enough	c
moral	c
education	c
,	c
and	c
a	c
lack	c
of	c
that	c
can	c
result	i
into	i
a	c
child	c
becoming	c
cruel	c
,	c
as	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
does	c
not	c
know	c
what	c
good	c
and	c
bad	c
is	c
.	c

So	c
topic	i
of	c

public	c

Finally	c

a	c
major	c

with	c
a	c

we	c
also	c
see	c
very	c
little	c

.	c

Crusial	i
increase	c
is	c
predicted	c
among	c
old	i
population	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
reasons	c
for	c
using	c
Facebook	c
are	c
sharing	c
photo	c
and	c
video	c
materials	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
receiving	c

The	c
underground	c
railways	c
are	c
compared	c
in	c
term	c
of	c
their	c
age	c
,	c
length	c
and	c
amount	c
of	c
users	c
per	c
year	c
.	c

Overall	c
,	c
the	c
distribution	c
of	c
users	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
preferred	c
network	c
is	c
clearly	c
seen	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
all	c
people	c
prefer	c
to	c
transtort	i
manufactured	c
goods	c
(	c
28	c
%	c
)	c
and	c
food	c
products	c
(	c
30	c
%	c
)	c
this	c
way	c
.	c

In	c
contrast	c
,	c
importing	c
of	i
food	c
to	c
other	c
countries	c
may	c
establish	c
strong	c
international	c
relationships	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
ways	c
which	c
can	c
help	c
us	c
to	c
fight	c
with	c
those	c
problems	c
.	c

The	c
number	c
of	c
private	c
companies	c
which	c
do	c
finance	c
scientific	c
research	c
programmes	c
grow	i
.	c

My	c
opinion	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
latter	c
is	c
,	c
despite	c
being	c
significantly	c
rigid	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
solution	c
to	c
the	c
issue	c
of	c
illegal	c
drugs	c
using	i
.	c

Becouse	i
creative	c
people	c
do	c
this	c
very	c
good	c
and	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
do	c
samthing	i
else	c
.	c

A	c
person	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	c
happy	c
if	c
he	c
hates	c
his	c
work	c
or	c
he	c
is	c
not	c
aware	c
of	c
what	c
he	c
should	c
do	c
his	c
life	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
that	c
in	c
Yemen	c
there	c
were	c
very	c
few	c
people	c
,	c
who	c
were	c
older	c
than	c
60	c
years	c
.	c

In	c
modern	c
society	c
some	c
people	c
feel	c
a	c
growing	c
demand	c
in	c
having	c
no	c
censorship	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
government	c
may	c
restrict	c
the	c
freedom	c
of	c
word	c
,	i
which	c
is	c
inapropriate	i
in	c
today	i
world	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
intriguing	c
how	c
people	c
balance	c
these	c
two	c
valuable	c
things	c
.	c

Nowdays	i
music	c
and	c
film	c
production	c
is	c
highly	c
developed	c

Most	c
people	c
prefer	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
and	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
free	c
time	c
,	c
while	c
others	c
do	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
spend	c
their	c
life	c
only	c
working	c
.	c

Children	c
in	i
early	c
ages	i
took	c
information	c
better	c
than	c
when	c
the	i
become	c
older	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
parents	c
of	c
Artem	c
who	c
is	c
5	c
years	c
old	c
punished	c
him	c
very	c
strictly	c
for	c
taking	c
a	c
toy	c
(	c
car	c
)	c
from	c
another	c
boy	c
in	c
a	c
kindergarden	i

Making	c
a	c
quality	c

huge	i

of	c
resours	i

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
people	c
who	c
think	c
differently	c

In	c

it	c
is	c
not	c

The	c

point	c

view	c
is	c
people	c

It	c
should	c
be	c
noted	i

the	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
people	c
who	c
strongly	c
believe	c
that	c
such	c
places	c
as	c
school	c

groups	c
are	i
played	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
part	c
in	c
your	c

On	c

interested	c

The	c
main	c
point	c
here	c
is	c
that	c
today	c
food	c
trading	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
necessary	c
for	c
each	c
country	c
in	c
the	c
world	c

And	c
concrete	i
number	c
of	c
male	c
and	c

could	c
help	c

to	c

It	c
is	c

that	c

In	c

1	c

the	c
period	c
from	c
2014	c
to	c
2015	c
.	c

One	c
,	i
of	c
the	c
important	c
questions	c
is	c
that	i
,	i
should	c
universities	c
accept	i
male	c
and	c
female	c
students	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
proportions	c
in	c
every	c
subject	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

To	c
look	c
at	c
the	c
matter	c
at	c
both	c
sides	c
,	c
i	c
try	c
to	c
illustrate	c
benefits	c
and	c
detriments	c
of	c
this	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
that	c
all	c
this	i
factors	c
can	c
be	c
involved	c
in	c
a	i
one	c
term	c
-	c
\"	c
self	c
-	c
realization	c
\"	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
Internet	i
provides	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
ways	c
for	i
showing	i
photography	c
,	c
museums	i
for	i
showing	i
pictures	i
.	c

If	c
we	c
have	c
more	c
facilities	c
for	c
sport	c
it	i
will	c
can	i
lead	c
to	c
bad	c
consequinces	i
.	c

The	c
percentage	c
in	c
1940	c
was	c
about	c
7	c
%	c
,	c
then	c
it	c
increased	c
gradually	c
but	c
after	c
1980	c
became	i
to	c
fluctuate	c
and	c
was	i
25	c
%	c
in	c
2040	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
different	c
lines	c
to	c
show	c
the	c
percentage	c
in	c
each	c
country	c
.	c

In	c
today	c
's	c
world	c
,	i
it	c
is	c
private	c
companies	c
rather	c
than	c
governments	c
who	c
pay	c
for	c
and	c
carry	c
out	c
most	c
scientific	c
research	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
usually	c
no	c
chances	c
to	c
stay	c
alive	c
in	c
air	c
craches	i
.	c

We	c
should	c
better	i
improve	c
our	c
cleansing	c
equipment	c
and	c
other	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
achieve	c
our	c
goals	c
,	c
we	c
also	c
feel	c
happiness	c
.	c

It	c
makes	c
the	c
process	c
of	c
studying	c
more	c
varied	c
and	c
effective	c
.	c

So	c
some	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
coutries	i
should	c
focuse	i
on	c
the	c
needs	c
of	c
its	c
citizens	c
and	c
try	c
to	c
produce	c
all	c
neccessary	i
goods	c
without	c
import	c
.	c

Most	c
people	c
sure	i
that	c
paying	c
a	c
huge	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
to	c
creators	c
or	c
locking	c
in	i
jail	i
for	c
a	c
long	c
period	c
will	c
stop	c
people	c
from	c
copying	c
files	c
.	c

In	i
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
share	i
of	c
younger	i
population	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
decrease	c
by	c
13	c
per	c
cent	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
suppose	c
that	c
users	c
who	c
practise	c
abovementioned	i
illegal	c
actions	c
should	c
be	c
punished	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
solve	c
this	c
problem	c
.	c

26	c
-	c
40	c
years	c
olders	i
show	c
the	c
least	c
interest	c
in	c
arts	c
content	c
,	c
just	c
a	c
quarter	c
of	c
students	c
may	c
be	c
affilated	i
to	i
this	c
age	c
group	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
that	c
every	c
person	c
took	c
care	c
about	c
his	c
health	c
by	c
itself	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
they	c
make	c
friends	c
with	c
other	c
pupils	c
who	c
play	c
a	c
big	c
role	c
in	c
the	c
child	c
's	c
development	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
strongly	c
agree	c
with	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
pirate	c
copie	i
is	c
a	c
theft	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
told	c
by	c
the	c
legal	c
law	c
,	c
the	c
process	c
of	c
film	c
copying	c
is	c
not	c
legal	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
people	c
involved	c
in	c
film	c
-	c
making	c
and	c
music	c
-	c
making	c
are	c
not	c
getting	c
payed	c
for	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
twice	c
as	c
many	i
as	c
Paris	c
railways	c
,	c
taking	i
the	c
second	c
place	c
in	c
kilometres	i
of	c
route	c
(	c
394	c
km	c
and	c
199	c
km	c
respectively	c
)	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
they	c
start	c
communicating	c
with	c
each	c
other	c
in	c
social	c
networks	c
and	c
several	c
months	c
later	c
they	c
can	c
not	c
stop	c
themselves	i
from	i
using	c
mobile	c
phones	c
almost	c
everywhere	c
during	c
the	c
whole	c
day	c
.	c

As	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
concluded	c
from	c
the	c
comparison	c
of	c
two	c
charts	c
,	c
different	c
goods	c
need	c
different	c
ways	c
of	c
transportation	c
.	c

But	c
will	c
it	c
be	c
enough	c
?	c

In	c
Sweden	c
this	c
progress	c
is	c
more	c
significant	c
:	c
from	c
7,5	c
%	c
to	c
25	c
%	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
while	i
in	i
Russia	i
it	c
is	c
summer	c
,	i
Brazil	c
has	c
a	c
winter	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
unlikely	c
to	c
waste	c
their	c
time	c
being	c
a	c
simple	c
worker	c
who	c
spends	c
his	c
entire	c
life	c
sitting	c
in	c
the	c
office	c
,	i
the	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
such	c
people	c
really	c
focus	c
their	c
attention	c
on	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
being	c
happy	c
now	c
without	c
stacks	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

Obviously	c
,	c
men	c
and	c
women	c
share	c
same	c
reasons	c
for	c
using	c
Facebook	c
.	c

The	c
chart	c
shows	c
changes	c
in	c
the	c
unemployment	c
rate	c
in	c

regions	c
in	c
2014	c
and	c
2015	c

Interestingly	c
,	c
in	c
Italy	c
by	c
2050	c
year	c
the	c
age	c
bracket	c
containing	c
citizens	c
aged	c
60	c
and	i
over	c
will	c
be	c
almost	c
two	c
times	c
larger	c
than	c
in	c
2000	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
now	c
is	c
far	c
from	c
being	c
solved	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
people	c
would	i
find	c
the	c
answer	c
and	c
build	i
happier	c
and	c
heathier	i
future	c
for	c
next	c
generations	c
.	c

If	c
a	c
sportsman	c
or	c
a	c
sportswoman	c
is	c
caught	c
on	c
something	c
that	c
he	c
/	c
she	c
did	c
n't	i
do	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
totally	c
unfair	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
parents	c
and	c
teachers	c
can	c
solve	c
this	c
problem	c
.	c

In	c
Europe	c
bar	i
represents	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c

0,4	c

Apparently	c
,	c
many	c
tree	i
are	c
knocked	c
down	c
and	c
woods	c
are	c
cleaned	i
out	c
,	i
resulting	i
natural	c
calamity	i
and	i
this	c
is	c
due	c
to	c
inefficient	i
love	c
and	c
respect	c
towards	c
the	c
environment	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
important	c
for	c
parents	c
and	c
teachers	c
to	c
teach	c
young	c
people	c
to	c
love	c
classic	c
literature	c
,	c
as	c
the	i
archive	c
of	c
human	c
wisdom	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
look	c
at	c
past	i
,	c
we	c
will	c
find	c
that	c
for	c
a	i
centuries	c
young	c
people	c
were	c
required	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
field	i
for	c
example	i
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
some	c
courses	c
could	c
be	c
organised	c
for	c
parents	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
the	c
ones	c
responsible	c
for	c
their	c
children	c
's	c
upbringing	c
including	c
their	c
mindsets	i
.	c

What	c
is	c
also	c
important	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
highest	c
rates	c
were	c
noted	c
in	c
North	c
America	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
the	c
percentage	c
of	c
urban	c
/	c
suburban	c
household	c
Internet	c
accesses	i
increased	c
almost	c
by	c
4	c
times	c
and	c
the	c
percentage	c
of	c
rural	c
household	c
Internet	c
accesses	i
increased	c
almost	c
8	c

that	c
in	c
general	c
speaks	i
about	c
the	c
development	c
of	c
the	c
Internet	c
in	c
the	c
country	c
.	c

In	c
1999	c
over	c
10	c
%	c
of	c
people	c
of	c

Basic	c
characteristics	c
can	c
make	c
studying	c
of	c
some	c
subjects	c
easier	c
or	c
harder	c
.	c

Because	c
all	c
of	c
these	c
aspects	c
are	c
useful	i
to	c
increase	i
through	c
other	c
countries	c
.	c

As	c
general	c
trend	c
there	i
will	c
be	c
a	c
sligh	i
raising	c
of	c
e	c

books	c

problem	c
if	c
you	c
find	i
it	c
out	i
in	c

another	c
fundamental	c

can	c

It	c

a	c

that	c

might	c

that	c
both	c

I	c
am	c
convinced	c
that	c
,	c
for	c

some	c

that	c

through	i
our	i

have	c
a	c
stronger	c
influence	c
on	c
our	c
behaviour	c

To	c
start	c
with	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
consider	c
that	c
such	c
influence	c
exists	c
,	c
because	c
without	c
this	c
point	c
we	c
can	i
move	c
on	c
in	c
out	i
little	c
research	c

First	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
remember	c
that	c
we	c
responsible	i
for	c
taking	c
care	c
of	c
ourselves	c
and	c
we	c
should	c
control	c
our	c
habbits	i

Overall	c

it	c
is	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
secret	c
that	c
upbringing	i
of	c
a	c
child	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
complicated	c
process	c
and	c
requires	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
effort	c
from	c
the	c
people	c
around	c

They	c
have	c
no	c
way	i
in	i

no	c

a	c
steady	c
growth	c

under	c
discussion	c

raising	c
from	c
approximately	c

In	c
the	c
conclusion	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
Yemen	c
low	c

and	c
the	c

of	c

Moreover	c
,	c
teachers	c
,	i
having	c
noticed	c
alarming	c
behaviour	c
of	c
some	c
sort	c
,	i
should	c
contact	c
the	c
child	c

parents	c
to	c
discuss	c
and	c
prevent	c
the	i
possible	c
problems	c
that	c
might	c
occur	c

That	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
mechanisms	c
how	c
young	c
people	c
can	c
start	c
to	c
commit	c
crimes	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
that	c
with	c
our	c
rapid	c
pace	c
of	c
life	c
this	i
variats	i
are	c
convenient	c
and	c
can	c
help	c
save	c
time	c
and	c
energy	c

Our	c

does	c
not	c

it	c
needs	c
pragmatic	i
way	c
of	c
creating	c

But	c
it	c
takes	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
to	c
works	i
in	c

to	c
form	c
your	c

While	i
,	c
as	c
for	i

,	i
their	c
plots	c
are	c
rather	c
monotonous	c
and	c
repeat	i
from	c
movie	c
to	c
movie	c
.	c

For	c
solving	c
this	c
problem	c
a	i
government	c
,	c
parents	c
and	c
teachers	c
must	c
act	c
.	c

Because	c
the	c
development	c
of	c
this	c
industry	c
gives	c
people	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
places	c
for	c
work	c

This	c
issue	c
should	c
be	c
analysed	c
and	c
measures	c
to	c
prevent	c
the	i
further	c
problems	c
should	c
be	c
implied	i
:	c
people	c
who	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
theft	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
punished	c

needless	i

not	c

Overall	c

the	c
highest	c
percentage	c
of	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
nice	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
year	c
break	c
between	c
11	c
years	c
study	i
and	c
the	c
following	c
4	c
years	c
of	c
education	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
're	c
planning	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
university	c

In	i
2018	i
prognise	i
that	c
eBook	i

for	c
tree	c

and	c
print	c

fall	i
for	c
same	i
number	c

Well	c
,	c
the	c
first	c
solution	c
to	c
this	c
problem	c
is	c
to	c
improve	i
the	c
censorship	c
,	c
so	i
to	i
only	c
good	c
and	c
useful	c
films	c
and	c
computer	c
games	c
be	i
available	c
for	c
children	c
.	c

The	c
economic	i
and	c
political	c
stability	c
stands	c
on	c
the	c
well	c
-	c
being	c
of	c
their	c
own	c
citizens	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
biggest	c
part	c
of	c
work	c
force	c
consists	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Thus	c
,	c
your	c
parents	c
can	c
give	c
you	c
an	i
advice	c
and	c
your	c
friends	c
could	i
be	c
a	c
great	c
for	i
leasure	i
activities	c
and	c
funny	i
time	c
.	c

For	c
this	c
reason	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
better	c
to	c
punish	c
people	c
,	i
who	c
share	c
and	c
download	c
pirate	c
copies	c
.	c

People	c
should	c
realise	c
own	i
possibilities	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
since	c
childhood	c
young	c
people	c
should	c
be	c
shown	c
that	c
crimes	c
commited	i
wit	c
the	c
use	c
of	c
the	c
Internet	c
are	c
not	c
anonymous	i
as	c
it	i
may	c
seem	c
first	i
and	c
,	c
therefore	c
,	c
lead	c
to	c
legal	c
concequences	i
and	c
should	c
be	c
seen	c
by	c
children	c
as	c
crimes	c
just	c
as	c
real	c
and	c
terrible	c
as	c
murder	c
.	c

We	c
should	c
have	c
another	i
hobbies	c
exept	i
social	c
networks	c
or	i
surfing	c
the	c
Internet	c
.	c

To	c
solve	c
this	c
problem	c
there	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
way	c
:	c
education	c
.	c

The	c
number	c
of	c
Yemen	i
young	c
people	c
aged	c
15	c
-	c
59	c
years	c
will	c
increase	c
under	c
58	c
%	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
mantioned	i
that	c
in	c
Yakutsk	c
the	c
temperatures	c
are	c
quite	c
different	c
during	c
the	c
year	c
and	c
they	c
depends	i
on	c
the	c
months	c
and	c
the	c
season	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
present	c
time	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
have	c
difficult	c
bind	c
of	c
problems	c
at	c
any	c
stage	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

Today	i
parents	c
are	c
really	c
busy	c
,	c
they	c
spend	c
a	c
bulk	c
of	c
their	c
time	c
on	c
the	c
job	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	i
relevant	c
feeling	c
for	i
our	c
society	c
.	c

Consequently	c
,	c
every	i
male	i
or	i
female	i
student	i
must	i
not	i
be	i
involved	c
in	c
adult	i
's	i
manipulations	c
.	c

In	c
summary	c
,	c
men	c
's	c
and	c
women	c
's	c
choices	c
in	c
post	c
-	c
school	c
qualifications	c
were	c
completely	c
different	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
characteristics	c
we	c
are	c
born	c
with	c
and	c
which	c
we	c
develop	c
during	c
our	c
lives	i
both	c
have	c
influence	c
on	c
our	c
personality	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
providing	c
possibilities	c
of	c
doing	c
sports	c
will	c
attract	c
teens	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
begin	c
with	c
advantages	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
mention	c
that	c
we	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
globalization	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
some	c
cultural	c
traditions	c
spreaded	i
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

But	c
what	c
about	c
children	c
?	c

We	c
are	c
to	c
focus	c
on	c
what	c
s	i
relevant	c
for	c
today	c
and	c
hence	c
we	c
are	c
to	c
invest	c
in	c
such	c
fields	c
and	c
,	c
as	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
scientific	c
space	c
exploration	c
is	c
an	c
excellent	c
opportunity	c
for	c
reaching	c
our	c
goals	c
,	c
mostly	c
,	c
for	c
progressing	c
and	c
improving	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
pie	c
charts	c
represent	c
the	i
data	c
about	c
the	c
transportation	c
of	c
goods	c
by	c
rail	c
and	c
road	c
in	c
Eastern	c
Europe	c
in	c
2008	c
.	c

The	c
cultural	c
heritage	c
of	c
various	c
countries	c
would	c
be	c
lost	c
,	i
if	c
architects	c
only	c
paiy	i
attention	c
to	c
the	c
buildings	c
'	c
functionality	c
.	c

In	c
contrast	c
,	c
the	c
food	c
products	c
in	c
goods	c
transported	c
by	c
rail	c
takes	i
only	c
11	c
per	c
cent	c
.	c

Another	c
reason	c
is	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
winning	c
with	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
drugs	c
is	c
against	c
the	c
simpliest	i
aspects	c
of	c
our	c
moral	c
code	c
that	c
says	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
highly	c
unfair	c
to	c
act	c
this	c
way	c
,	c
expecially	i
in	c
respond	c
to	c
those	c
who	c
are	c
loosing	i
while	c
following	c
the	c
rules	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
material	i
that	c
have	c
approximately	c
the	c
same	c
percentage	i
in	c
transportation	i
by	c
both	c
ways	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
life	c
I	c
also	c
was	c
corrupted	c
by	c
thi	i
horrible	c
feeling	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
family	c
,	c
teachers	c
and	c
friends	c
bring	c
me	c
to	c
life	c
and	c
show	c
me	c
path	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
on	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
.	c

This	c
essay	c
firstly	c
will	i
discuss	i
the	c
main	c
cause	c
of	c
the	i
health	c
problems	c
,	c
secondly	c
the	c
essay	c
will	i
offer	i
some	c
solutions	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
remarkable	c
that	c
the	c
overall	c
unemployment	c
rate	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
is	i
the	c
same	c
in	c
2014	c
and	c
2015	c
,	c
accounting	c
for	c
5,9	c
percent	c
.	c

In	c
the	i
Middle	c
East	c
it	c
was	c
11	c
%	c
in	c
2014	c
then	c
get	i
lower	c
to	c
9,6	c
%	c
.	c

Both	c
the	c
chart	c
and	c
the	c
table	c
gives	i
information	c
about	c
children	c
,	c
but	c
when	i
the	c
chart	c
provides	c
information	c
about	c
children	c
who	c
have	c
problems	c
with	c
weight	c
during	c
20	c
years	c
,	c
the	c
table	c
is	i
shown	i
how	c
many	c
children	c
did	c
sport	c
in	c
one	c
country	c
during	c
the	c
same	c
period	c
.	c

Maybe	c
they	c
will	c
make	i
a	c
rough	i
rools	i
for	c
student	i
,	c
maybe	c
someone	c
wo	i
n't	i
go	c
to	i
the	c
class	c
he	c
wants	c
-	c
because	c
there	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
will	c
be	c
enough	c
boys	c
.	c

Naturally	i
children	c
are	c
prone	c
to	c
immitate	i
adults	c
behaviour	c
,	c
especcially	i
the	c
behaviour	c
of	c
their	c
parents	c

The	c
graph	c
depicts	c
the	c
information	i
of	i
the	c

different	c
counries	i
from	c
1970	c
to	c
2015	c
.	c

All	c
things	c
considered	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
deny	c
that	c
our	c
personality	c
depends	c
on	c
all	c
types	c
of	c
characteristics	c
:	c
both	i
we	c
are	c
born	c
with	c
and	c
we	i
get	c
through	i
having	c
the	c
new	c
experience	i
and	i
gaining	c
knowledge	i
.	c

New	c
sport	c
equipment	c
,	c
new	c
training	c
methods	c
can	c
sometimes	c
allow	c
even	c
things	c
that	c
may	c
have	c
been	c
called	c
a	c
miracle	c
the	i
last	c
century	c
.	c

I	c
personally	c
think	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
disadvantages	c
of	c
the	c
trend	c
outweight	i
the	c
advantages	c
and	c
agree	c
with	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
for	c
that	c
.	c

The	c
chart	c
falls	i
from	c
11	c
%	c
to	c
9,6	c
%	c
and	c
from	c
6,8	c
%	c
to	c
5,8	c
%	c
in	c
Middle	i
East	i
and	c
Latin	c
America	c
respectively	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
many	c
people	c
think	c
of	c
what	c
must	c
be	c
and	c
what	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
part	c
of	c
this	c
process	c
,	c
is	i
that	c
home	i
or	c
some	c
outside	c
influences	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
Russia	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
see	c
rapid	c
growth	c
in	c
number	i
of	c
drug	c
addicts	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
usually	c
young	c
.	c

Our	c
world	c
slowly	i
becomes	i
as	c
one	c
,	c
the	c
traditions	c
are	c
barely	c
thrown	i
in	c
the	c
past	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
the	c
oldest	c
generations	c
will	c
prevail	c
and	c
rich	i
almost	c
60	c
percents	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
true	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
significant	c
problem	c
of	c
rising	i
number	c
of	c
diseases	c
caused	c
by	c
usage	i
of	c
technology	c
,	i
in	c
the	c
modern	c
world	c
.	c

The	c
biggest	c
difference	c
between	c
minimum	i
and	c
maximum	i
is	c
about	c
fourteen	c
degrees	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
employers	c
support	c
them	c
more	c
than	c
others	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
wrong	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
fuss	c
,	c
victims	c
of	c
this	c
punishment	c
finish	i
their	c
sport	c
career	c
at	i
all	i
.	c

In	c
some	c
case	i
,	c
it	c
sounds	c
foolish	c
to	c
spend	c
so	c
much	c
time	c
working	c
hard	c
,	c
breaking	i
nervous	c
system	c
and	c
being	c
unhappy	c
and	c
depressive	c
.	c

The	c
graphs	c
below	c
represent	c
the	c
information	c
about	c
goods	c
'	i
transportation	c
between	c
East	c
European	c
countries	c
in	c
2008	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
despite	c
this	c
change	c
,	c
the	c
percentages	c
of	c
girls	c
and	c
boys	c
in	c
all	c
years	c
were	c
relatively	c
close	c
with	c
the	c
greatest	c
difference	c
of	c
3	c
per	c
cent	c
.	c

The	c
line	c
graphs	c
illustrate	c
the	c
average	c
of	c
highest	c
and	c
lowest	c
temperatures	c
in	c
two	c
cities	c
(	c
Yakutsk	c
and	c
Rio	c
de	c
Janeiro	c
)	c
of	c
Russia	c
and	c
Brazil	c
over	c
a	c
year	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
widespread	c
availability	c
of	c
Internet	c
access	c
and	c
popularity	c
of	c
different	c
sources	c
of	c
information	c
,	i
which	c
portray	c
crimes	c
in	c
a	c
positive	c
light	c
,	c
as	c
acts	c
of	c
courage	c
and	c
gaining	c
respect	c
among	c
peers	c
and	c
among	c
some	c
specific	c
social	c
layers	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
is	i
also	c
a	c
country	c
,	c
which	c
the	c
British	c
prefer	i
Spain	c
.	c

It	c
takes	i
only	c
2	c
%	c
.	c

That	c
table	c
bellow	i
illustrates	c
the	c
information	c
about	c
underground	c
railway	c
systems	c
in	c
six	c
different	c
cities	c
.	c

Firstly	i
they	c
would	c
steal	c
a	c
chocolate	c
bar	c
from	c
the	i
shop	c
,	c
but	c
then	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
extremelly	i
close	c
to	c
the	c
criminal	c
life	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
disadvantages	c
of	c
this	c
idea	c
outweigh	c
its	c
advantages	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
thing	c
is	c
not	c
to	c
lose	c
the	c
possibility	i
but	c
to	c
use	c
it	c
properly	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
from	c
different	c
bands	i
or	c
gipsy	i
,	c
who	c
have	c
not	i
their	i
own	c
family	c
and	c
house	c
and	c
they	c
just	c
should	i
alive	c
.	c

I	c
personally	c
believe	c
,	c
that	c
this	c
issue	c
should	c
be	c
considered	c
as	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
such	c
kind	c
of	c
quotation	i
leads	c
to	c
the	i
descrimination	i
of	c
some	c
students	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
timeless	c
restriction	c
could	c
prevent	c
this	c
situation	c
.	c

The	c
figures	c
do	c
not	c
change	c
greatly	c
throughout	c
the	c
year	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
it	c
's	c
always	c
to	c
begin	c
a	c
new	c
theme	c
(	c
project	c
)	c
to	c
educate	c
.	c

Some	c
may	i
think	c
that	c
creating	c
complex	c
architectual	i
designs	c
is	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
time	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
made	c
for	c
everyday	c
use	c
.	c

Person	c
who	c
always	c
takes	c
mobile	c
phone	c
in	c
his	c
pocket	c
has	c
a	c
risk	c
to	c
get	c
cancer	c
and	c
some	c
other	c
dangerous	c
desiases	i
when	c
he	c
will	c
be	c
old	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
biggest	c
problem	c
.	c

In	c
Germany	c
and	c
China	c
the	c
numbers	c
will	c
increase	i
on	i
0,5	c
billion	c
dollars	c
only	c
(	c
from	c
1	c
to	c
1,5	c
billion	c
dollars	c
in	c
Germany	c
and	c
from	c
0,5	c
billion	c
dollars	c
to	c
1	c
billion	c
in	c
China	c
)	c
.	c

They	c
claim	c
that	c
government	c
should	c
restrict	c
artist	c
from	c
an	c
extraodinary	i
ways	c
of	c
expression	c
their	c
own	c
ideas	c
.	c

They	c
should	c
not	c
allow	c
their	c
children	c
to	c
watch	c
too	c
much	c
television	c
during	c
the	c
day	c
and	c
try	c
to	c
organize	c
their	c
free	c
time	c
,	i
so	i
that	i
the	i
Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
reason	c
of	c
increasing	i
of	c
youth	i
crime	i
may	i
be	c
the	c
high	c
consumption	i
of	c
drugs	c
and	c
alcohol	c
between	i
the	c
youngsters	i
.	c

They	c
can	c
be	c
avoid	c
genetic	i
modified	c
food	c
because	i
products	c
which	c
were	c
made	c
in	c
their	c
country	c
are	c
safer	c
and	c
they	c
know	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
there	c
should	c
be	c
punishments	c
for	c
online	c
piracy	c
;	c
the	c
punishment	c
should	c
be	c
lowered	i
base	i
on	c
the	c
types	i
of	c
content	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
tendency	c
that	c
people	c
prefer	c
American	c
and	c
British	c
films	c
to	c
their	c
local	c
ones	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
notable	i
to	c
see	c
that	c
the	c

in	c
a	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
summing	c
up	c
all	c
the	c
arguments	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
downturns	i
in	c
prefering	i
free	c
time	c
to	c
money	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
unproductive	c

In	c

to	c

an	c
accurate	c
and	c

young	c
people	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
example	c
they	i
had	c

The	i
both	i
points	c
of	c
view	c
have	c
their	c
own	c
pros	c
and	c
cons	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
personally	c
think	c
that	c
every	c
country	c
should	c
improve	c
conditions	c
of	c
producing	c
food	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
good	i
to	c
say	c
,	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
subjects	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
prefered	i
only	c
by	c
boys	c
or	c
girls	c
in	i
universities	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
in	c
2008	c
in	c
Europe	c
by	i
rail	i
were	i
transported	i
most	i
often	i
metals	i
,	i
manufactured	i
goods	i
,	c
while	c
by	i
road	i
were	i
transported	i
food	i
products	i
and	i
also	i
manufactured	i
goods	i
.	c

The	c
highest	c
rate	c
is	c
mentioned	c
in	c
USA	i
(	c
from	c
9	c
%	c
to	c
15	c
%	c
)	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
people	c
who	c
live	c
in	c
developed	c
countries	c
have	c
another	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
feature	c
we	c
should	c
pay	c
attention	i
on	i
is	c
the	c
gap	c
between	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
kids	c
younger	c
than	c
14	c
in	c
these	c
countries	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
accurate	c
and	c
proper	c
using	c
of	c
neuclear	i
-	i
electro	i
stations	c
with	c
new	c
safe	c
technologies	c
may	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
sensible	c
way	c
of	c
getting	c
energy	c
infuture	i
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
people	c
currently	c
prefer	c
to	c
spend	c
more	c
time	c
working	c
at	c
the	c
offices	c
or	c
maybe	c
working	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

The	c
same	c
popularity	c
for	c
men	c
has	i
receiving	c
updates	c
,	c
it	c
ts	i
also	c
39	c
%	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
evidiently	i
trend	c
is	c
undergraduate	c
diploma	c
and	c
postgraduate	c
diploma	c
.	c

This	c
will	c
discrimine	i
some	c
tallented	i
students	c
,	c
who	i
is	c
able	c
to	c
enter	c
a	c
university	c
to	i
study	c
hard	c
.	c

In	i
many	i
times	i
their	c
productes	i
can	c
have	c
bad	c
influence	c
on	c
peoples	i
thinking	c
.	c

Not	c
bad	i
seen	i
have	i
a	c
future	i
.	c

In	c
2010	c
the	i
agriculture	c
is	c
the	c
unpopular	c
sphere	c
of	c
working	c
between	i
all	c
genders	c
in	c
Australia	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
figures	c
start	c
to	c
rise	c
rapidly	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
period	c
-	c
between	c
9	i
o'clock	i
and	c
13	i
o'clock	i
.	c

But	c
sport	c
provide	c
not	c
only	c
phsysical	i
health	c
but	c
the	c
mental	c
one	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
tv	i
and	c
video	c
games	c
strongly	i
enfluence	i
on	c
people	c
's	c
psychology	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
not	c
all	c
countries	c
have	c
enogh	i
fertile	c
farm	i
lands	i
to	c
produce	c
enough	c
food	c
to	i
all	c
their	c
population	c
,	c
and	c
alternative	c
methods	c
of	c
producing	c
food	c
are	c
not	c
as	c
effective	c
.	c

The	c
level	c
of	c
this	c
country	c
was	i
slowly	c
decrease	i
from	c
23	c
per	c
cent	c
to	c
10	c
per	c
cent	c
and	c
just	i
a	i
little	i
rise	c
to	c
13	c
per	c
cent	c
.	c

And	c
they	c
dramatically	c
influenced	i
on	i
us	c
and	c
our	c
health	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
have	c
increasing	i
number	c
of	c
health	c
problems	c
because	c
of	c
modern	c
technologies	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	i
we	c
should	c
give	c
another	c
chance	c
to	c
a	c
person	c
who	c
might	c
just	i
stepped	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
right	c
way	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
head	c
of	c
a	c
school	c
should	c
also	c
somehow	c
be	c
involved	c
in	c
process	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stress	c
that	c
problems	c
with	c
student	c
behavior	c
are	c
the	c
results	c
of	c
parents	c
'	c
and	c
teachers	c
'	c
mistakes	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
people	c
who	c
do	c
not	c
share	i
this	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
universities	c
play	c
a	c
huge	c
role	c
in	c
the	c
human	c
society	c
.	c

Overall	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
that	c
majority	c
of	c
telephone	c
calls	c
was	c
provided	c
by	c
local	c
-	c
fixed	c
line	c
during	c
the	c
whole	c

50	i
-	i
64	i
years	i

men	i
and	i
women	i

Facebook	i
mostly	i

as	i
previous	i
age	i
groups	i
-	i
there	i
are	i
63	i
per	i

Facebook	i

It	c
important	i
for	c
many	c
people	c
because	c
they	c
economy	i
their	c
money	c

Theese	i
professions	c
are	c
ment	i
to	c
be	c
strictly	c
technical	c
and	c
have	c
practical	c
purpose	c
,	c
though	c
their	c
works	c
can	c
be	c
done	c
aesthetically	i
beautiful	i
.	c

There	c
should	c
be	c
no	c
government	c
restrictions	c
on	c
their	c
works	c
.	c

Also	i
people	c
can	c
change	c
their	c
place	c
of	c
living	c
onc	i
a	c
year	c
for	c
relax	c
from	c
influence	i
of	c
technolodies	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
free	c
download	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
stage	c
for	i
rising	c
popularity	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
not	c
agree	c
with	c
it	c
but	i
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
I	i
will	i
not	c
say	c
that	c
aesthethics	i
is	c
the	c
first	c
and	c
the	i
last	c
thing	c
which	c
architects	c
should	c
worry	c
about	c
.	c

For	c
instanse	i
,	c
international	c
community	c
has	c
faced	c
the	c
severe	c
problem	c
of	c
terrorism	c
for	c
years	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
burning	c
question	c
withe	i
the	c
situation	c
of	c
film	i
and	c
music	c
robberies	i
.	c

Overall	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
three	c
types	c
of	c
courses	c
and	c
different	c
age	c
groups	c
extened	i
in	c
certain	c
proportion	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
an	c
opinion	c
that	c
people	c
become	c
less	c
healthy	c
nowadays	c
than	c
they	c
were	c
some	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
male	c
concentrate	c
on	c
subjects	c
,	c
whereas	c
women	c
distract	i
boys	i
and	i
themselves	i
on	i
feelings	i
and	c
may	c
do	c
not	c
pay	c
appropriate	i
attention	c
to	c
the	c
process	c
of	c
studying	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
import	c
and	c
export	c
develop	c
the	c
economy	c
of	c
the	c
country	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
it	c
it	i
not	c
surprising	c
that	c
people	c
work	c
their	c
fingers	i
off	i
to	c
get	c
a	c
well	c
-	c
paid	c
and	c
socially	c
respectful	i
job	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
view	c
,	c
every	c
teacher	c
should	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
maybe	c
prepare	c
a	c
short	c
speech	c
on	c
different	c
topics	c
in	c
crime	c
and	c
the	c
health	c
of	c
every	c
student	c

After	c

do	c
n't	c

out	c

In	c
both	c

is	c
that	c
quantity	i

takes	c
about	c
a	c
half	c
of	c

at	c
any	c
time	c
.	c

Overall	c
,	c
after	c
2030	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
people	c

65	c

a	c

the	c
highest	c

And	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
helpfull	i
for	c
those	c
people	c
who	c
do	c
n't	c

any	c

want	c
to	c
be	c
the	i
part	c
of	c
the	c
fans	c
or	c

So	c
,	c
parents	c
do	c
not	c

their	c
children	c
and	c
do	c
not	c
tell	c
them	c
how	c
they	c
need	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
seeing	c
the	c

in	c
proper	i

will	c
help	c

do	c
we	c

That	c
's	c
why	c

position	c
is	c
prooved	i
by	c

sum	c
up	c

there	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
a	c

in	i

But	c
there	c
are	c
those	c

who	c

that	c
such	c
athletes	c
should	c
be	c
banned	c
forever	c
and	c
never	c
be	c
welcome	c
in	c

.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
limits	c
artist	c
casn	i
not	c
always	c
offer	c
result	c
of	c
their	c
work	c
to	c
public	c
.	c

They	c
lose	c
money	c
because	c
pirate	c
copies	c
is	i
selled	i
and	c
people	c
buy	c
it	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
several	c
reasons	c
for	c
making	c
this	c
social	c
phenomenon	c
legal	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
Bafu	i
Hasikow	c
,	c
the	c
world	c
champion	c
in	c
mixfighting	i
,	c
was	c
considered	c
to	c
have	c
weak	c
mental	c
possibilities	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
believe	c
that	c
in	c
orderer	i
to	c
achieve	c
this	c
goal	c
we	i
should	c
build	c
new	c
sports	c
facilities	c
.	c

I	c
personally	c
think	c
,	c
that	c
one	c
disadvantage	c
can	c
outweigh	c
the	c
advantages	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
understandably	c
that	c
scientific	c
researches	c
require	c
unbiased	c
ground	c
.	c

Knowing	c
who	c
their	c
child	c
is	c
friends	c
with	c
is	c
also	c
necessary	c
,	c
because	c
peers	c
often	c
shape	c
each	c
other	c
's	c
mindsets	i
,	c
which	c
sometimes	c
results	c
in	c
seemingly	c
quiet	c
kids	c
being	c
involved	c
in	c
bullying	c
or	c
any	c
kind	c
of	c
activities	c
that	c
include	c
violence	c
.	c

So	c
maybe	c
there	c
are	c
other	c
measures	c
that	c
goverment	i
can	c
do	i
.	c

The	c
problem	c
of	c
the	c
younger	c
generation	c
being	c
involved	c
in	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
crimes	c
is	c
crucial	c
nowadays	c

What	c
about	c

Any	c

All	c
in	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
advances	c
in	c
technology	c
give	c
us	c
a	c
good	c
chance	c
to	c
improve	c
our	c
live	c
conditions	c
,	c
but	c
people	c
should	c
not	c
rely	c
on	c
them	c
,	i
paying	c
no	c
attention	c
to	c
the	c
development	c

And	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
punished	c

the	c

The	c

Looking	c
deeper	c
into	c

of	c

,	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
stated	c
that	c
some	c

sum	c
up	c

due	c

the	c

that	c
there	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
personally	c
thin	i
that	c
it	c
is	c
great	c
for	c
some	c

The	c
last	c

is	c
that	c

It	c
is	c

that	c

In	c

In	c
Japan	c
this	c
index	c
was	c
approximately	c
5	c
%	c
in	c
1940	c
,	c
then	c
it	c
felt	i
down	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
that	i
it	c
is	c
well	i
-	c
known	c
fact	c
that	c
nowadays	c
majority	i
of	c
schools	c
offer	c
opportunities	c
for	c
children	c
and	c
young	c
people	c
to	c
learn	c
not	c
only	c
state	i
language	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
to	c
learn	c
different	c
foreign	c
languages	c
.	c

Many	c
countries	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
have	c
financial	c
problems	c
linked	c
to	c
export	c
and	c
import	c
questions	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
obviously	i
that	c
physical	c
exercises	c
make	c
people	c
more	c
resistable	i
to	c
illness	i
.	c

The	c
government	c
usually	c
try	c
to	c
controll	i
the	c
situation	c
and	c
protect	c
producer	c
of	c
content	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
to	c
improve	c
public	c
health	c
governoment	i
should	c
create	c
some	c
laws	c
about	c
requires	i
for	c
salesman	c
about	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
their	c
products	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
people	c
60	i
years	c
and	c
older	c
will	c
increase	c
on	c
18	c
%	c
.	c

So	i
politicy	c
of	c
pretension	i
may	c
be	c
more	c
effective	c
in	c
countries	c
without	c
special	c
regulations	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
note	c
it	c
even	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
when	c
usually	i
boys	c
are	c
better	i
in	i
physics	c
,	c
mathematics	c
,	c
chemistry	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
no	c
doubt	c
that	c
sport	c
is	c
still	c
playing	c
a	c
vital	c
role	c
in	c
people	c
's	c
lives	c
and	c
the	c
aspect	c
of	c
drugs	c
used	c
by	c
sportsmen	c
had	c
not	c
vanished	c

The	c
highest	c

diploma	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
on	c
35	c
percent	c
more	c
,	c
than	c
mans	i
.	c

Thus	c
,	c
things	c
can	c
get	c
better	c
and	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
no	c
crime	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
data	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
qualification	c
between	c
women	c
was	c
undergraduate	c
diploma	c
and	c
less	c
popular	c
was	c
postgraduate	c
diploma	c
.	c

In	c
that	c
case	c
that	c
kind	c
of	c
restrictiont	i
could	c
prevent	c
the	c
further	c
dopping	i
scandales	c
and	c
not	c
to	c
crush	c
the	c
whole	c
professional	c
life	c
of	c
the	c
spotsman	i

The	c
lowest	c

is	i
shown	c
by	c
South	c
Asia	i
,	i
which	c
level	c
remains	i
stable	c
in	c
both	c

and	c
is	i
3,9	c
%	c
,	c
which	c
is	i
2	c

lower	c
than	c
the	c

Overall	c

the	c

As	i
far	i
as	i
can	i
be	i
judged	i
according	i
to	i
the	i
graph	i
the	c
proportion	c
of	c

increased	c
in	c
Sweeden	i

from	c

was	c
a	c

in	c
this	c
catecory	i
of	c

in	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
the	c
period	c
of	c
history	c
of	c

and	c
other	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
inclined	c
to	c
state	c
that	c
the	c
most	c
persuasive	c
argument	c
in	c
favour	c
of	c
equal	c
studying	c
is	c
that	c
male	c
and	c
female	c
students	c
have	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
thinking	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
concernes	i
the	c
eBook	c
market	c
,	c
again	c
,	c
the	c
USA	c
have	c
the	c
highest	c
points	c

both	c
for	c
2014	c
and	c
2018	c

the	c
minimum	c
temperature	c
accounted	i
for	i
22	c

above	c

.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
when	c
child	i
has	c
a	c
year	c
between	c
finishing	c
high	c
school	c
and	c
starting	c
university	c
studies	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
can	c
make	c
a	i
own	c
choice	c
what	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
want	i
in	c
the	i
future	c
career	i

We	c
must	c
only	c
find	c
talented	c
freedom	c

or	c
stupid	c
provocation	c
witch	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
be	c

watched	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
people	c
who	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
rich	c
or	c
just	c
have	c
a	c
little	c
more	c
money	c
than	c
they	c
have	c
now	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
an	c
example	c
from	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Import	c
of	c
food	c
not	i
just	c
make	c
economy	c
stronger	c
,	c
but	c
also	i
can	c
help	i
other	c
countries	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
,	i
that	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
solutions	c
for	c
overcoming	c
this	c
problem	c
,	c
but	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
adults	c
should	c
understant	i
the	c
main	c
reason	c
why	c
their	c
children	c
have	c
committed	c
the	c
crime	c
.	c

Our	c
world	c
is	c
developing	c
,	c
the	c
cities	c
are	c
extending	i
,	c
people	c
are	c
constructing	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
new	c
buildings	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
really	c
important	c
now	c
,	c
our	c
population	c
is	c
rising	c
every	c
year	c
and	i
because	c
of	c
this	c
people	c
need	c
more	c
places	c
to	c
live	c
,	c
work	c
,	c
learn	c
and	c
relax	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
clear	c
that	c
producing	c
too	c
much	c
food	c
for	c
other	c
countries	c
can	c
lead	c
to	c
some	c
problems	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
widespreade	i
opinion	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
a	c
bad	c
impact	c
on	c
people	c
's	c
health	c
and	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
health	c
diseases	c
increases	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
essay	c
I	c
will	c
try	c
to	c
view	c
all	c
the	c
points	c
and	c
support	c
it	c
by	c
examples	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
are	c
people	c
,	c
who	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
method	c
of	c
making	c
sport	c
important	c
would	c
have	c
not	c
so	i
huge	c
effect	c
on	c
public	c
health	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
this	c
case	c
the	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
such	c
arrangements	c
break	c
the	c
freedom	c
of	c
will	c
and	c
action	c
which	c
is	c
so	c
actively	c
propogandized	i
in	c
the	c
modern	c
world	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
opposite	c
opinion	c
exists	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
time	c
.	c

Thereafter	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
25	c
men	c
reduced	c
the	c
time	c
they	c
did	c
sport	c
significantly	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
statement	c
that	c
can	c
not	c
be	c
argued	c
but	i
family	c
members	c
still	c
should	c
have	c
an	c
influence	c
on	c
children	c
-	c
at	c
least	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
teach	c
them	c
how	c
to	c
manage	c
so	c
-	c
called	c
peer	c
pressure	c
and	c
not	c
to	c
suffer	c
from	c
excessive	c
peer	c
influence	c
-	c
i.e.	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
consider	c
critically	c
what	c
they	c
hear	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
slowly	c
rose	c
and	c
to	i
1999	c
it	c
was	c
by	i
26	c
.	i

If	c
the	c
government	c
spend	i
too	c
much	c
time	c
,	i
trying	c
to	c
help	c
another	c
places	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
for	c
its	c
own	c
one	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
that	c
increasing	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
sport	i
facilities	c
is	c
great	c
option	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
will	c
work	c
only	c
with	c
the	c
tight	c
integration	c
with	c
other	c
methods	c
,	c
because	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
improvement	c
had	c
been	c
already	c
done	c
before	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
lack	c
of	c
the	c
enthusiasm	c
and	c
information	c
has	i
failed	c
.	c

The	c
figure	c
of	c
it	c
is	c
1,8	c
billion	c
US	c
dollars	c
in	c
2014	c
.	c

The	c
sport	c
may	c
help	c
to	c
be	c
solve	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
thankful	i
results	c
are	i
in	c
the	i
South	c
Asia	c
with	c
3,9	c
percents	i
of	c
not	i
working	i
people	c
.	c

Modern	c
life	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
unfair	c
.	c

However	i
there	c
is	i
a	c
problem	c
in	c
European	i
Union	i
,	c
the	c
level	i
of	c
unemployment	c
increased	i
and	c
nowadays	c
experts	c
predict	c
that	c
situation	i
is	c
going	c
to	c
become	c
worse	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
described	c
how	c
family	c
or	c
other	c
different	c
agents	c
can	c
influence	c
the	c
development	c
of	c
a	c
kid	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
strongly	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
family	c
has	c
the	c
strongest	c
impact	c
,	c
because	c
even	c
if	c
a	c
person	c
was	c
affected	c
by	c
a	c
bad	c
company	c
and	c
changed	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
grew	i
up	c
,	i
they	c
would	c
mostly	c
behave	c
like	c
their	c
parents	c
.	c

The	c
lowest	c
unemployment	c
can	i
be	c
found	c
in	c
South	c
Asia	c
,	c
and	c
in	c
this	c
region	c
we	c
can	c
also	c
see	c
stable	i
level	c
of	c
unemployment	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
it	c
may	c
turn	c
into	c
intervention	c
,	i
if	c
the	c
other	c
countries	c
are	c
reluctant	c
to	c
interdefere	i
.	c

Machinery	c
also	c
changed	c
the	c
volume	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
noticeable	c
changes	c
in	c
proportions	i
of	c
different	c
types	c
of	c
goods	c
transported	c
by	c
road	c
and	c
by	c
rail	c
in	c
2008	c
,	c
with	c
manufactured	c
goods	c
remain	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
largest	c
group	c
for	c
transportation	c
.	c

Our	c
relatives	c
accompany	c
us	c
during	c
the	c
whole	c
life	c
and	c
are	c
always	c
ready	c
to	c
give	c
the	c
best	c
advice	c
and	c
to	c
help	c
in	c
a	c
tough	c
situation	c
.	c

While	i
a	c
person	c
is	c
being	i
born	c
in	c
a	c
country	c
and	c
is	c

by	c

the	c

In	c

they	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
history	c
knows	c
many	c
examples	c
of	c
outstanding	c
scientists	c
of	c
both	c

It	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
find	c
some	c
connections	c
between	c
crime	c
level	c
and	c
level	c
of	c
the	i
education	c
,	c
economic	c
situation	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
within	i
the	c
help	c
of	c
investigators	c
it	c
may	c
be	c
considered	i
Switzerland	i
as	i
a	c
neutral	c
zone	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
means	c
even	c
the	c
governments	c
of	c
countries	c
that	c
are	c
not	c
related	c
to	c
any	c
kind	c
of	c

may	c
still	c
saffer	i

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
clearly	c
seen	c
that	c
manufactured	c
good	i
,	c
metal	c
and	c

products	c
are	c
the	c
most	c

Therefore	c

I	c
suppose	c
advantages	c

will	c
outweigh	c
the	c
drawbacks	c

Some	c
people	c
believe	c
that	c

the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
improve	c
public	c
health	c

whereas	c
others	c
consider	c
that	c
it	c
brings	c
a	i
little	c

this	c
type	c

I	c
would	c

to	c
say	c
that	c

in	c

should	c

This	c
position	c
is	c

in	c

him	c

In	c
my	c

it	c

In	c

it	c

that	c

But	c
we	c
should	c
keep	c

that	c

something	c

very	c
quickly	c

it	c
can	c
also	c

To	c
start	c
with	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
clear	c
from	c
the	c

Thus	c

by	i

What	c
is	c
more	c

Neither	c

So	c
,	c
comparing	c
indonesia	i
with	c
Australia	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
said	c
that	c
the	c

There	c
are	c
absolutely	c
different	c
ways	c
for	i

this	c
crucial	c

I	c
strongly	c

my	c

Some	c

who	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	i
illegal	c

the	c
premier	i

the	i

Overall	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
conclude	i
the	c
information	c
in	c
the	c
tables	c

Moreover	i
these	c
problems	c
will	c
be	c
reduced	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
problem	c
of	c
those	c

who	c
copy	c

on	c
the	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
aspects	c
of	c
this	c
problem	c
is	c
a	c
number	c
of	c

First	c
of	c
all	c

low	c
prices	c

sports	c

or	c
activities	c

like	c
swimming	c

,	c
will	c
increase	c
the	c
public	c
health	c

Especially	c
,	c
these	c

the	c
areas	c
which	c
have	c
very	c
big	c
audience	c

such	c
as	c

are	c
developing	c
significantly	c

Scientists	c
claim	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
fact	c
that	c
some	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
neccessarily	i
need	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
high	c
income	c
to	c
be	c

and	c
it	c
is	c
essential	c
for	c
them	c
to	c
feel	i
an	c
amount	c
of	c
leisure	c
time	c
behinde	i
their	c
backs	c

Some	c
people	c
believe	c
,	i
that	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
nesessary	i
to	c
accept	c
equal	c
proportions	c
of	c
male	c

female	c
,	i
according	c
to	c
every	c
subject	c

while	c
others	c
don	c
t	c
see	c
any	c
point	c
in	c
it	c

In	c
comparison	c
,	c
Italy	c
had	c
the	c
biggest	c
percentage	c

(	i
61.6	c

However	i
modern	c
medicine	c
is	c
developing	c
too	i

there	i
is	i
no	i

to	i

your	c

Even	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
the	c

interests	c
it	c
hard	i
to	c
study	c
togethe	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
moral	c
aspect	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
architecture	c
should	c
have	i
a	i
cultural	i
meaning	i
also	c
and	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
explain	c
why	c
in	c
my	c
essay	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
see	c
positive	i
changes	c
in	c
Middle	i
East	i
and	c
Latin	c
America	c
.	c

What	c
matters	c
most	c
in	c
this	c
case	c
that	i
the	c
person	c
feel	i
comfortable	c
and	c
appcacemental	i
only	c
in	c
a	c
good	c
political	c
and	c
economic	i
situation	c
in	c
the	c
world	c

It	c
is	c
impossible	c
to	c
imagine	c
Paris	c

London	c
without	c
well	c
-	c
known	c
masterpieces	c
,	i
such	c
as	c

At	i
the	c
USA	c
the	c
temp	i
of	c

is	c
similar	i
than	i
in	c

In	c
the	c
beginning	c
we	c
will	c
talk	c
about	c
the	c
highest	c
temperatures	c
of	c
these	c
cities	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
simple	c
advice	c
is	c
to	c
regurite	i
the	c
time	c
,	i
which	c
can	c
be	c
spent	c
for	i
tecnins	i

Both	c
views	c
should	c
be	c
discussed	c
before	c
coming	c
to	c
definite	c
conclusion	c
.	c

Only	c
35	c
%	c
of	c
men	c
have	c
the	i
bachelor	c

which	c
is	c
10	c
%	c
less	c
than	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
women	c
with	c
this	c
qualification	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
difference	c
between	c
graphs	i
is	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
no	c
months	c
when	c
the	c
temperature	c
falls	c
and	c
stays	c
under	i
0	c

in	c
Rio	c

but	c
there	c
are	c
8	c
months	c
in	c

then	i
the	c
temperature	c

under	i
0	c

C	c
and	c
falls	c
to	c

40	c

C	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
taking	c
everything	c
noted	i
up	i
into	c
account	c
it	i
can	i
be	i
seen	i
that	c

The	c
second	c
one	c
is	c
that	c
sometimes	c
they	c
do	c
not	c

they	c
really	c
are	c
as	i
there	c
is	c
no	c
evidance	i
or	c
statics	i
about	c

it	c

And	c
I	c
also	c
think	c
,	i
that	c
art	c
(	c
becauise	i
movies	c
and	c
music	c
is	i
a	c
kind	i
of	c
art	c
)	c
should	c
n't	i
be	c
commercial	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
why	c
the	i
artists	c
should	c
share	c
it	i
with	c
people	c
.	c

They	c
have	c
thouse	i
features	c
,	c
those	c
specification	i
because	c
their	c
parent	i
,	c
their	c
grandparents	c
,	c
their	c
friends	c
and	c
neighbours	c
,	c
so	c
,	c
all	c
Italians	c
have	c
them	c
.	c

This	i
two	c
kinds	c
of	c
good	i
compare	c
only	i
in	i
two	c
per	c
cents	i

For	c
instance	c
,	c
people	c
who	c
want	c

not	c

Why	c
work	c
hard	c
on	c
the	i
manufacture	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
just	c
go	c
and	c
sell	c
some	c
drugs	c
or	c
rob	c
someone	c
?	c

We	c
can	c
see	c
that	c
in	c
some	c
regions	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
North	c
Africa	c
and	c
South	c
Asia	c
the	i
unemployment	c

did	c
not	c
change	c
.	c

One	c
more	c
option	c
is	c
special	c
restrictions	c
in	c
law	c
,	c
abolishing	c
the	c
usage	c
of	c
gun	i

It	c
has	c

now	i
it	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
agree	c
with	c
opinion	i

that	c

point	c

the	c

With	c
both	c

it	c
is	c

that	c

Also	i
it	i
must	c
be	c
added	i
that	c
by	c

China	c
's	c
amount	c
of	c

reached	c
about	c
88	c

in	c
the	i
1970	c
it	c
was	c
about	c
98	c

it	c

that	c

To	i
my	i

everything	c

To	c

I	c
let	c
myself	c
to	c
conclude	c
that	c

what	c
about	c

Intertaining	i
business	c

the	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
two	c
minds	c
about	c
this	c
issue	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
to	c
notice	i
that	c
old	c
buildings	c
can	c
help	c
us	c
to	i
\"	c
feel	c
the	c
history	c
\"	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
more	c
than	c
the	c
half	c
of	c
the	c
whole	c
using	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
parents	c
try	c
to	c
provide	c
their	c
children	c
with	c
vital	i
view	c
on	c
life	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
based	c
on	c
parents	c
'	c
life	c
perception	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
that	c
similar	c
rights	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
busical	i
rules	c
of	c
modern	c
world	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
chance	c
to	i
realize	i
system	c
of	c
equal	c
male	i
and	c
female	c
students	c
only	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
dishonest	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	i
arguments	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
would	c
count	i
on	i
government	c
this	c
duty	c
that	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
effect	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

This	c
lack	c
leads	c
us	c
to	c
lack	i
of	c
education	c
about	c
good	c
and	c
evil	c
,	c
and	c
concequences	i
of	c
evil	c
steps	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	i
people	c
have	c
the	c
tand	i
to	c
copy	c
the	c
behaviour	c
of	c
other	i
proportion	c
and	c
it	c
form	i

In	c
order	c
to	c
solve	c
this	c
problem	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
the	c
government	c
should	c
restrict	c
the	c
activity	c
of	c
creative	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
's	i
the	c
easiest	c
way	c

without	c

All	c
things	c

there	c
are	c
polar	c

opinions	c
on	c
the	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
to	c

such	c

it	c

nesseccary	i
for	c

to	c

As	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
nothing	c
with	c
fact	i
that	c
internet	i
changes	c
markets	c
,	c
so	c
content	c
creators	c
should	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
change	c
their	c
models	c
of	c
monetisation	c

make	c

more	c

The	c
only	c

be	c
created	c
only	c
by	c
the	c
common	c
will	c
of	c
society	c
,	c
so	c
these	c
rules	c
will	c
become	c
some	c
moral	c
orientiers	i
for	c
artists	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
it	c
more	c
easy	c
to	c
distinguish	c
where	c
the	c
expression	c
of	c
themselves	c
can	c
hurt	c

The	c

Namelly	i

one	c
of	c
the	c

a	c

agree	c
with	c
all	c
the	c

also	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c

we	c

biggest	c

the	c

of	c

not	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
possible	c
solution	c
of	c
it	c
is	c
presecution	i

convincing	c

that	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c

a	c

Besides	c
,	c
they	c

In	i
my	c

the	c

number	c
of	c
male	c
and	c

students	c
should	c
be	c
equal	c
in	c
every	c
subject	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
in	c
our	c
modern	c
society	c
and	c
word	i
people	c
should	c
respect	c
each	c
others	i
and	c
their	c
works	i

The	c
pie	c

the	c
proportions	c
of	c
people	i

in	c

in	c
Yemen	c
in	c
2000	c
and	c
expected	i
situation	c
in	c
2050	c

There	c
is	i
at	c
1,4	c

The	c
information	c
presented	c
on	i
the	c
given	c
chart	c
and	c
table	i
shows	c
both	i
the	c
percentages	i
of	c
overweight	i

physically	c

and	c

changing	c

Equal	c
number	c
of	c
male	c

leads	c
to	c
the	c
situation	c
when	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
give	c
their	c
universities	c
up	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
the	c
cult	c
of	c
sport	i
is	c
forever	c
lost	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
primary	c
school	c
may	c
be	c
the	c
perfect	c
time	c
to	c
learn	c
as	c
much	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

The	i
women	i

more	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
may	c
notice	c
from	c
the	c

the	c
overall	c
fraction	c
of	c
children	c
doing	c
regular	c
physical	c
activity	c
increased	c
for	c
both	c
the	c
categories	c
(	c
from	c

and	c
from	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
given	c
statistics	c
,	c
the	c
country	c
where	c
the	c
level	c
of	c
difference	c
is	c
the	c
highest	c
is	c
Japan	c
,	c
where	c
it	c
is	c
40	c
per	c
cent	c
in	c
1980	c
and	c
30	c
per	c
cent	c
in	c
1995	c
while	c
the	c
country	c
with	c
the	c
lowest	c
difference	c
is	c
New	c

with	c
its	c
roughly	c
22.5	c
per	c

in	c

and	c
around	c
12.5	c

in	c

But	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
interesting	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
true	c
characteristics	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
so	c
many	c
beautiful	c
variations	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

Considering	i
me	i
,	c
I	c
srongly	i
brlieve	i
that	c
time	c
has	c
much	c
more	c
to	c
give	c
than	c
money	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
agreed	c
by	i
many	c
people	c
that	c
equal	c
numbers	c
of	c
boys	c
and	c
girls	c
should	c
study	c
at	c
Universities	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
same	c
year	c
,	c
in	c
Italy	c
,	c
children	c
were	c
only	c
in	c
14,3	c
%	c
of	c
Italy	c
's	c
population	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
older	c
people	c
make	c
almost	c
the	c
quarter	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
more	c

the	c

the	i
fewer	c

they	c
take	i

the	c

Thise	i
essay	c
will	c
look	c
both	i
sides	i
of	c
thise	i
statements	c
and	i
later	c
I	c
impress	i
my	c
own	c
opinion	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
should	c
be	c
mention	i
that	c
producing	c
only	c
for	c
our	i
population	c
can	c
be	c
really	c
good	c
for	c
some	c
reasons	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
governments	c
should	c
combine	c
their	c
efforts	c
to	c
diminish	c
ecological	c
footprint	c
and	c
use	c
of	c
electricity	c
,	i
as	c
well	c
as	c
to	c
improve	c
sustainability	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
some	c
women	c
are	c
really	c
more	c
productive	c
in	i
various	c
spheres	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
if	c
people	c
have	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
sports	c
objects	c
regulary	i
,	c
they	c
would	c
be	c
much	c
more	c
healthy	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
spend	c
time	c
on	c
sport	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
on	c
smoking	c
,	c
taking	c
drugs	c
or	c
drinking	c
alcohol	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
remember	c
that	c
full	c
dependence	c
on	c
import	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
symptom	c
of	c
the	c
healthy	c
economy	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	c
proportion	c
of	c
women	c
with	c
undergraduate	c
diploma	c
was	c
higher	c
than	c
that	c
of	c
men	c
by	c
30	c
percent	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	c
20th	c
century	c
has	c
brought	c
many	c
modern	c
institutions	c
partly	c
substituting	c
family	i
,	c
such	c
as	c
kindergardens	i
and	c
boarding	c
schools	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
summer	c
schools	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

The	c
older	c
group	i
is	c
,	c
the	c
highest	c
decrease	c
in	c
Facebook	c
usage	c
is	c
observed	c
.	c

In	c
general	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
incedents	i
and	c
ways	c
to	c
solve	c
them	c
must	c
be	c
chosen	c
regarding	c
to	c
the	c
case	c
.	c

Likewise	c
,	c
in	c
our	c
world	c
,	c
especially	c
nowadays	c
,	c
every	c
person	c
should	i
show	c
the	c
loest	i
results	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
standards	c
are	c
high	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
significant	c
difference	c
is	c
obvious	c
.	c

Difference	c
in	c
income	c
in	c
Germany	c

The	c

The	c

among	c

in	c

it	c
is	c
worth	c
mentioning	c
that	c

And	c
they	c
can	c
do	c
what	c
they	c
want	c

But	c
there	c
are	i
some	i
doubts	i
that	c
this	c
would	c
not	c

in	i
a	i
good	i

strongly	c
believe	c
that	c

have	i
a	c
serious	c

us	c
that	c
our	c

do	c
not	c
have	c
so	c
much	c
influence	c
on	c

To	c
conclude	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
write	c
that	c

to	c

banned	c

of	c

Another	c
advantage	c
of	c

is	c
that	c
many	c

which	c
means	c
they	c
can	c
always	c

with	c

In	c
conclusion	c

modern	c

an	c
important	c
part	c
of	c

To	c
prevent	c

from	c
growing	c
up	c
in	c
such	c
circumstances	c
a	c

should	c
be	c

This	c
country	c
could	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
speculate	c
on	c
this	c

to	c
figure	c
out	c
the	c

Overall	i

from	c

As	c
for	c
Australia	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
from	c
the	c

not	c

As	c

the	c

Thus	c

the	c

There	c
is	c
a	c

that	c

,	c
this	c

totally	c
agrees	c
that	c
a	c

of	c

Another	c
reason	c
of	c
such	c
trend	c
can	c
be	c
the	c
lack	c
of	c

In	c
2050	c
,	c
the	c

middle	c
-	c
ageg	i
people	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
increase	c
by	c
9	c
%	c

due	c
to	c
the	c
decrease	c

the	c

13	c

of	c
the	c

As	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
i	i
think	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
use	c
all	c
we	c
can	c
get	c
.	c

First	c
and	c
more	c
importantly	c
,	c
if	c
the	i
building	c
is	c
both	c
pleasant	c
to	c
look	c
at	c
and	c
do	i
its	c
own	c
function	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
far	c
more	c
efficient	c
for	c
people	c
who	c
live	c
or	c
work	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

Another	c
issue	c
is	c
that	c
all	c
in	c
all	c
they	c
are	c
built	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
the	c
city	c
centre	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
why	c
the	i
most	c
find	i
it	c
less	c
attractive	c
than	c
the	c
city	c
centre	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
people	c
usually	c
offer	c
bad	i
quality	i
copies	c
which	c
can	c
badly	i
impress	i
audience	i
and	c
they	c
will	c
not	c
get	c
true	c
emotions	c
and	c
feelings	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
a	c
song	c
,	c
the	c
lyrics	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
melody	c
should	i
be	c
written	c
first	c
and	c
then	c
the	c
sound	c
needs	c
to	c
be	c
recorded	c
and	c
edited	c
so	c
that	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
it	c
is	c
high	c

As	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
teachers	c
can	c
help	c
-	c
they	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
discuss	c
with	c
their	c
students	c
different	c

that	c
everyone	c

a	c
law	i
way	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
create	c
many	c
new	c
problems	c
in	c
society	c
too	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
true	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
people	c
outside	c
the	c
home	c
influence	i
children	c
's	c
views	c
on	c
life	c
much	c
stronger	c
that	i
their	c
own	c
family	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
is	i
failed	i
to	c
consider	c
that	c
only	c
a	c
small	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
can	c
have	c
such	c
a	c
\"	c
facility	i
\"	c
.	c

Let	c
us	c
take	c
the	c
example	c
of	c
modern	c
France	c
,	c
where	c
similar	c
law	c
,	c
concerning	c
only	c
people	c
without	c
any	c
job	c

encourages	c
thousands	c
of	c

poor	c
people	c
to	c
benefit	c
from	c
it	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
significant	c
factor	c
in	c
achieving	c
happiness	c
such	c
as	c
an	c
intension	i
to	c
be	c
happy	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
data	c
,	c
the	c
older	c
person	c
is	c
,	c
the	c
less	c
support	c
he	c
gets	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
period	c
the	i
number	c
of	c
old	c
people	c
increase	i
doubled	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
equal	c
about	i
42,3	c
percent	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
biggest	c
one	i
is	c
manufactured	c
goods	c
(	c
28	c
%	c
)	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
sometimes	c
they	c
forget	c
about	c
people	c
around	c
them	c
and	c
about	c
moral	c
principals	i
.	c

As	c
for	c
Japan	c
,	c
this	i
one	i
has	c
different	i
way	i
of	c
population	c
growth	i
than	i
others	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
,	c
that	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
my	c
oppinion	i
,	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
acception	i
equal	c
number	i
of	c
boys	c
and	c
girls	c
in	c
universities	c
seems	c
to	i
me	i
unreliable	c
.	i

I	c
hope	c
,	c
that	c
their	c
attitudes	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
will	c
be	c
better	c

years	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
problem	c
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
and	c
the	c
interests	c
of	c
civilians	c
and	c
businesmen	i
are	c
both	c
important	c
and	i
the	c
ways	c
which	i
were	c
described	c
earlier	c
present	c
themselves	c
a	i
compromise	c
between	c
too	c
radical	c
decisions	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
secret	c
that	c
some	c
universities	c
have	c
limited	c

in	c
subjectos	i
of	c
males	c

females	c

A	c
great	c

film	c

write	c
and	c
record	c
high	c
-	i
qualitive	i
music	c
album	c
.	c

And	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
think	c
,	i
that	c
people	c
,	c
who	i
copying	i
,	i
sharing	i
or	i
downloading	i
films	i

music	i
from	i

should	c
be	c
punished	c

We	c

not	c
prohibit	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
world	c
trading	i
of	c
food	c
is	c
a	c
lovely	i
possibility	c
to	c
eat	c
some	c
tasty	c

food	c
not	c
going	i
out	i
from	i

It	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
for	c
a	c
pupils	c
of	c
a	c
high	c
school	c
and	c
for	c
a	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

Also	c
there	c
is	c
an	c
opposite	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
and	c
it	c
also	c
has	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
to	c
believe	c
in	c

Food	c
products	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
products	c
for	c
road	c

Moreover	c
,	c
students	i
of	c
this	c
age	c
were	c
not	c
keen	c
on	c
sport	c
:	c
only	c
15	c
%	c
of	c
them	c
chose	i
sports	c
and	c
health	c
courses	c
which	i
is	i
4	i

Sometimes	c
,	c
they	c
could	c

carefully	c
preserve	c
their	c

,	c
making	c
them	c
all	c
conditions	c
for	c
good	c
work	c
.	c

Another	c
reason	c
for	c
having	c
more	c
spare	c
time	c
is	c
that	c
in	c
this	c
case	c
people	c
's	c
life	c
does	c
not	c
concentrate	c
on	i
work	i
only	c

It	c
equals	i

Other	c

not	c

enough	c

But	c
in	i
the	c

time	c
the	i
first	c
place	c
in	c

is	i
food	c

The	c

All	c

According	i
to	i

we	c
can	c

that	c

to	c
summer	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
other	c
numbers	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
said	c
that	c
for	c
undergraduate	c
diploma	c
there	c
are	c
70	c
%	c
of	c
females	c
while	c
twice	c
as	c
less	c
for	c
males	c
.	c

Moreover	i
,	c
from	c
2000	c
the	c
percentage	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
was	c
on	i
the	c
same	c
level	c
representing	i
14	c
per	c
cent	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
imposible	i
to	c
isolate	c
from	c
other	c
countries	c
and	c
produce	c
only	c
your	c
own	c
food	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
late	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
thing	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
such	c
process	c
like	c
globalisation	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
temperature	c
rise	c
local	c
farmers	c
are	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
grow	c
some	c
types	c
of	c
crops	c
which	c
once	c
were	c
essential	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
region	c
.	c

Second	i
,	c
some	c
people	c
have	c
no	c
chance	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
useful	i
content	c
.	c

They	c
argue	c
that	c
freedom	c
of	c
expression	c
hurt	c
their	c
own	c
freedom	c
and	c
their	c
life	c
safety	c
.	c

The	c
striking	c
feature	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
proportion	c
of	c
such	c
people	c
has	c
increased	c
for	c
each	c
country	c
from	c
1940	c
to	c
2040	c

received	c
after	c
their	c

Maybe	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
many	c

to	c
prefer	c

But	c
there	c
is	c
another	c
opinion	c

To	c
conclude	c

the	c

To	c
my	c
mind	c

the	c

argument	c
has	c
a	c
stronger	c

argumentation	c

We	c

with	c
this	i

that	c
nowadays	c

that	c

There	c
are	c
three	c

Contrariwise	i

the	c
number	c
of	c

that	c

less	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
behaviour	c
of	c
young	c
people	c
depends	c
on	c
how	c
they	c
grew	c
up	c

Overall	c
,	c
what	c
stands	c
out	c
from	c

that	c
the	c

First	c

Having	c
evaluated	c
every	i
thing	i
mentioned	c
above	c

it	c
can	c
be	c
confirmed	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
essential	c
for	c

to	c
go	c
outdoors	c

it	c

the	c

quite	c

So	c

according	c

we	c
ca	i
n't	i
know	c
if	c
someone	c
used	c

We	c

-	c

The	c
amount	i
of	c
those	c
people	c
are	i
increasing	c
these	c
days	c
because	c
the	c
Internet	c
is	c
considered	c
to	c
be	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
parts	c
of	c

due	c
to	c

It	c
is	c

Of	c
course	c
our	i

in	i

much	i
to	i

that	i

as	i

numbers	i
of	i
male	i

students	i
in	i

will	i
not	i

And	c
the	c

A	c
typical	c
example	c
is	c
the	c
practice	c
in	c
some	c
schools	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
to	c
organise	c
excursions	c
to	c
prisons	c

where	c

have	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
evaluate	c
the	c
situation	c
and	c
make	c
the	c
necessary	c
conclusions	c
.	c

Such	c
organisations	c
are	c
not	c
afraid	c
of	c
experiments	c
and	c
create	c
a	c
positive	c
image	c
of	c

In	c

the	c

Also	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
that	c

Criminality	c
is	c
always	c
a	c
problem	c
for	i

in	c

the	c

that	c

The	c

the	c

professional	c

the	i
most	i

They	c
should	c

interested	c

These	c
safety	c
measures	c
could	c
contribute	c
to	c
the	c
solution	c
of	c
this	c

Actually	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
doubt	c
,	i
that	c
communication	c
between	c

a	i
boys	c
is	c
essential	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
also	c
strongly	c
believe	c
that	c
children	c
's	c
friends	c
,	c
school	c
or	c
just	c
street	c
have	c
more	c
influence	c
on	c
them	c
due	c
to	c
the	i
number	c
of	c
reasons	c
.	c

That	c
means	c
that	c
countries	c
that	c
have	c
market	c
economy	c
could	c
not	c
exist	c
with	c
the	c
monopoly	c
and	i
it	c
can	c
lead	c
to	c
the	c
destruction	c
of	c
the	c
political	c
system	c

To	c
sum	c
everything	c
up	c
,	c
in	c
2014	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
printed	c
books	c
outweigh	i
the	c
quantity	c
of	c
electronic	c
ones	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
nearest	c

the	c
situation	c
tends	c
to	c
be	i
changed	i

So	c
,	c
generally	c
speaking	c
,	c
men	c
prefered	i
to	c
have	c
undergraduate	c
diploma	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
note	c
that	c
architecture	c
as	c
a	c
profession	c
is	c
almost	c
unique	c
regarding	c
this	c
issue	c
,	i
because	c
even	c
such	c
things	c
as	c
clothes	c
or	c
furniture	c
are	c
way	c
less	c
essential	c
and	c
expensive	c
.	c

In	c
Italy	c
the	c
situation	c
is	c
different	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
noticeable	c
that	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
way	c
for	c
transportation	c
metals	c
is	c
by	c
rail	c
,	c
while	c
road	i
are	c
used	c
mostly	c
for	c
food	c
products	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
useless	c
to	c
ban	c
pirate	c
sources	c
because	i
I	c
know	c
at	c
least	c
one	c
perfect	c
way	c
to	c
decrease	c
illegal	c
copying	c
.	c

Also	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
other	c
ways	c
to	c
improve	c
public	c
health	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
emphasize	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
right	i
answer	c
to	c
this	c
question	c
:	c
where	c
we	i
should	c
spend	c
money	c
.	i

Let	c
us	c
start	c
by	c
considering	c
pros	c
and	c
cons	c
of	c
this	c
opinion	c

There	c
is	c
about	c
90	c
percent	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

The	c
films	c
and	c
music	c
are	c
no	c
difference	c
,	c
just	c
the	c
price	c
of	c
them	c
is	c
distributed	c
among	c
several	c
people	c
or	c
things	c
(	c
like	c

There	c
is	c
an	c
opinion	c
that	c

the	c

On	c

it	c
is	i
nearly	c
8	c

One	c
purpose	c
does	c
not	c
always	c
have	c
to	c
exclude	c
another	c

What	c
is	c
more	c

The	c

provides	c
information	c
about	c
typical	i
daily	c
demand	c
for	c
electricity	c
in	c
England	c
in	c
winter	c
and	c
summer	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
for	c
turists	i
because	c
of	i
the	c
level	i
of	i
their	c
hearth	i
can	i
decrease	c
.	c

And	c
for	i
2015	c
year	c
it	c
is	i
higher	c
than	c
in	c
2014	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
cause	c
of	c
majority	i
of	c
diseases	c
in	c
present	c
is	c
the	c
widespread	c
use	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
everyone	c
have	i
different	c
thoughts	i
on	i
their	c
future	c
career	c
,	i
specialization	c
.	c

To	c
explain	c
my	c
point	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
easy	c
to	c
take	c
the	c
example	c
of	c
China	c
that	c
provides	c
population	c
almost	c
with	c
all	c
commodities	c
and	c
also	c
imports	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
goods	c
and	c
food	c
from	c
abroad	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
can	c
not	c
grow	c
every	c
food	c
domestically	c
.	c

Paris	c
,	c
Tokyo	c
and	c
Washington	c
DC	c
are	c
close	c
in	c
numbers	c
too	c
,	c
having	c
199	c
,	c
155	c
and	c
126	c
km	c
respectively	c
.	c

It	c
also	c
includes	c
a	c
forecast	c
of	c
changes	i
in	c
both	c
markets	c
for	c
2018	c
.	c

Taking	c
for	c
instance	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
people	c
who	c
have	c
everything	c
family	i
,	c
love	c
,	c
money	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
feel	c
nervous	c
and	c
anxious	c
about	c
all	c
those	c
and	c
try	i
not	i
to	i
lose	i
these	c
qualities	i
.	c

We	c
can	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
biggest	c
part	c
of	c
population	i
is	c
midle	i
age	i
people	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
these	c
problems	c
can	c
be	c
solved	c
in	c
the	c
nearest	c
future	c
.	c

This	c
led	c
to	c
constant	i
smoge	i
on	c
the	c
streets	c
which	c
led	c
to	c
that	c
almost	c
every	c
citizen	c
has	i
problems	c
with	c
their	i
lungs	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
the	c
biggest	c
difference	c
between	c
genders	c
was	c
in	c
skilled	c
vocational	c
diplomas	c
,	c
while	c
30	c
%	c
to	c
70	c
%	c
.	c

United	c
States	c
line	c
almost	i
was	c
not	i
changing	c
in	c
this	i
45	c
years	c
-	c
it	c
only	c
decreased	c
from	c
100	c
to	c
approximately	c
85	c
procent	i
.	c

Some	c
people	c
belive	i
that	c
the	i
cause	i
is	c
radiation	c
.	c

And	c
sometimes	c
it	c
is	i
causing	i
problems	c
with	c
health	c
.	c

To	c
put	c
it	c
in	c
a	c
nutshell	c
,	c
the	c
graphs	c
show	c
that	c
the	c
most	c
part	c
of	c
electricity	c
in	c
English	c
houses	c
is	c
used	c
in	c
winter	c
and	c
for	c
heating	c
.	c

To	c
my	c
mind	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
indeed	c
true	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
government	c
's	c
main	c
job	c
to	c
focus	c
on	c
people	c
of	c
their	c
country	c
.	c

Hence	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
remove	c
him	c
from	c
competition	c
and	c
give	c
him	c
certain	c
time	c
,	c
a	c
year	c
or	c
some	c
years	c
,	c
to	c
keep	c
himself	c
in	c
fit	c
and	c
compete	c
with	c
other	c
candidates	c
,	c
without	c
dopping	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
some	c
kinds	c
of	c
sports	c
might	c
be	c
used	c
in	c
treatment	i
of	c
people	c
who	c
have	c
some	c
physical	c
restrictions	c
and	c
with	c
development	c
of	c
facilities	c
for	c
this	i
sports	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
easier	c
for	c
these	c
people	c
to	c
live	c
full	i
life	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
in	c
some	c
cases	c
parents	c
give	c
their	c
children	c
either	c
inappropriate	c
nurture	c
or	c
do	c
not	c
care	c
about	c
them	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
starts	c
to	c
decrease	c
and	c
becomes	c

This	c
essay	c

what	c

by	c

The	c

period	c
from	c

It	c
is	c
clear	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
complex	c
problem	c
which	c
may	c
not	c
have	c
any	i
perfect	c
solutions	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
good	c
to	c

at	c

that	c

Last	c

not	c
the	c

todays	i
world	c
is	c
world	i
of	c

where	c
the	c
smallest	i

.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
increasing	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
sports	c
facilities	c
is	c
not	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
make	c
people	c
healthier	c
,	i
because	c
it	c

From	c

the	c

up	c

22	c

25	c
percent	c
for	c
girls	c

relatively	i
though	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
significant	c
rise	c
in	c
percentage	i
of	c

Some	c

its	c

So	c
there	c
is	i
plenty	c
solutions	c
that	c
may	c
give	c
results	c
,	c
but	c
today	c
there	c
is	i

there	c

can	c
give	c
some	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
what	c
parents	c
should	c
do	c
is	c
to	i
give	c
enough	c
care	c
and	c
attention	c
to	c
their	c
children	c

Not	c
all	c
at	c

,	c
so	c
that	c
you	c
'll	c
be	c
in	c
a	i
big	c
trouble	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
not	c
to	c
allow	c
to	c
any	c
artists	c
to	c
express	c
their	c
own	c
ideas	c

they	c
suppose	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
come	c
out	c
in	c
support	c
of	c
this	c
view	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
way	c
it	c
is	c
essential	c
to	c
teach	c
both	c
children	c
and	c
adults	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
careful	c
about	c
their	c
health	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
end	i
,	c
chemicals	c
has	i
nearly	c
the	c
same	c
share	c
on	c
the	i
both	c
diagrams	c
,	c
so	c
it	i
is	i
transported	c
by	c
rail	c
as	c
often	c
as	c
by	c
road	c
.	c

As	c
shown	c
,	c
in	c
2008	c
the	c
bigest	i
part	c
of	c
rail	c
transportation	c
is	c
metals	c
,	c
it	c
take	c
's	c
35	c
%	c
of	c
total	c
amount	c
.	c

To	c
my	c
mind	c
,	c
both	c
points	c
of	c
view	c
are	c
right	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
Singapoore	i
builds	c
high	c
-	c
tech	c
systems	c
to	c
grow	c
as	c
many	c
plants	c
on	c
their	c
territory	c
as	c
they	c
can	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
modern	c
world	c
humanity	c
starts	c
to	c
worry	c
more	c
about	c
their	c
health	c
and	c
way	c
of	c
living	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
tables	c
show	c
that	c
more	c
men	c
and	c
women	c
were	c
emploed	i
in	c
servises	i
both	c
in	c
Australia	c
and	c
Indonesia	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
always	c
arrogant	c
,	c
cruel	c
,	c
rude	c
or	c
too	c
stubborn	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
creative	c
people	c
need	c
in	c
possibility	c
to	c
express	c
their	c
feelings	c
or	c
idea	c
.	c

Money	c
is	c
just	c
a	c
tool	c
to	c
survive	c
.	c

Hovever	i
,	c
people	c
who	c
think	c
differently	c
still	c
exist	c
,	c
so	c
according	c
to	c
my	c
favorite	c
saying	c
\"	c
many	c
men	c
,	c
many	c
minds	c
\"	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
society	c
should	c
watch	c
on	c
young	c
generation	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
in	c
Middle	i
East	i
and	c
Latin	c
America	c
the	c
level	c
of	c
unemployment	c
decreased	c
and	i
in	c
the	c
EU	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
contrary	c
,	c
increased	i
.	c

Another	i
qualification	c
is	c
undergraduate	c
diploma	c
.	c

Last	c
point	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
is	c
my	c
own	c
opinion	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
regard	c
,	c
she	c
gave	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
tips	c
on	c
recognizing	c
good	c
or	i
bad	c
people	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
people	c
who	c
think	c
that	c
creative	c
celebrities	c
exaggerate	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
and	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
crazy	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
bar	c
chart	c
shows	c
,	c
the	c
quantity	c
of	c
both	c
girls	c
and	c
boys	c
,	i
who	c
were	c
overweigh	i
gradually	c
increased	c
.	c

Anothe	i
way	c
of	c
improving	c
health	c
is	c
using	c
of	c
ecological	c
transport	c
like	c
a	c
bicycle	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
countries	c
in	i
our	c
planet	c
,	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
are	c

The	c
opinions	c
about	c
this	c

are	c
very	c
different	c

I	c
agree	c
with	c
them	c

in	c
my	c
opinion	c
not	i
every	c
university	c
must	c
have	c
the	i
equal	c
number	c
of	c
women	c

Comparing	c
the	c
situation	c
in	c
2000	c
in	c
two	c
countries	c
it	c
is	c
seen	c
that	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
children	c
(	c
0	c
-	c
14	c
years	c
)	c
is	c
much	c
bigger	c
in	c
Yemen	c
(	c
50,1	c

then	c
in	c
Italy	c
(	c
14,3	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
scandal	c
on	c
the	c
Olympic	c
Games	c
in	c
Rio	c
about	c
drugs	c

some	c

were	c
banned	c

After	c
all	c
,	c
everything	c
happening	c
to	c
one	c
in	c
the	c
moment	c
creates	c
memories	c
which	c
make	c
their	i
life	c
unique	c

teach	c
them	c
their	c
lessons	c

make	c
their	c

On	c
the	c
otherhand	i
,	c
many	c
people	c
still	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
and	c
not	c
to	c
earn	c
more	c
money	c

Implementation	i
of	c
that	c
requirement	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
effective	c
and	c

of	c
male	c
and	c

student	c
is	c
unlikely	c
to	c

On	i
the	i
other	i

that	i
created	c
by	c

I	c
personally	c
think	c
that	c
illegal	c
drugs	c
are	c
enormously	c
harmfull	i
for	c
our	c
health	c
and	c
athlets	i
should	c
avoid	c
such	c
a	c
sticky	c
situations	c
when	c
somebody	c
says	c
that	c
they	c
used	c
them	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
advice	c
for	c
the	c
government	c
to	c
make	c
airline	c
companies	c
turn	c
to	c
natural	c
resources	c

In	c

It	c
is	c
a	c

what	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
reduce	c

the	c

In	c
conclusion	c

producing	c

the	c

that	c

In	c
this	c
essay	c
I	c
will	c
try	c
to	c
prove	c
why	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
more	c
efficient	c

to	c
strike	c
the	c
balance	c
between	c
these	c
two	c
ways	c

rather	c
than	c
to	c
stick	c

only	c

And	c
if	c
the	c

he	c
can	i
get	c
some	c
skills	c

which	c
will	c
be	c
necessary	c
in	c
their	i
future	c

Some	c
people	c
deside	i
to	c

up	c
their	c
own	c
business	c
but	c
others	c
prefer	c
to	c
work	c
for	c

due	c
to	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
small	c

May	c
be	c
the	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c

it	c
can	c
be	c

in	c
different	c

But	c
how	c
to	c
motivate	c
people	c
to	c
improve	c
their	c
health	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c

not	c

Secondly	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
maintain	c
good	c
relationships	c
with	c
other	c
countries	c
we	c
need	c
to	c

and	c

The	c

the	c

Science	c
,	c
Arts	c
and	c
Sports	c
and	c
Health	c
areas	c
.	c

The	c
opponents	c
believe	c
that	c
stars	c
and	c
producers	c
pay	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
and	c
forces	c
to	c
create	c
something	c
special	c
for	c
their	c
audience	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
graph	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
rise	c
in	c
the	c
proportion	c
of	c
people	c
aged	c
65	c
and	c
over	c
in	c
Japan	c
from	c
10	c
%	c
in	c
2020	c
to	c
27	c
%	c
in	c
2040	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
surely	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
anything	c
to	c
serve	c
its	c
purpose	c
starting	c
with	c
casual	c
notebooks	c
and	c
ending	c
with	c
scientific	c
investigations	i
.	c

I	c
absolutely	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
opinion	c
for	c
the	c
several	c
reason	i
.	c

People	c
feels	i
calmer	c
,	i
when	c
they	c
visit	c
a	c
nice	c
light	c
hospital	c
,	c
not	c
a	c
dark	c
ugly	c
building	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
personally	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
enough	c
.	c

When	c
the	i
governments	c
use	c
their	c
natural	c
resources	c
for	i
only	c
their	i
local	i
population	c
,	c
they	c
do	c
not	c
waste	c
a	c
lot	c
,	i
which	c
means	c
nature	c
does	c
not	c
suffer	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

In	c
developed	c
countries	c
with	c
the	c
highest	c
level	c
of	c
education	c
and	c
with	c
large	c
opportunities	c
of	c
studying	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
.	c

The	c
largest	c
proportion	c
of	c
goods	c
delivery	c
comprised	c
manufactured	c
goods	c
for	c
both	c
types	c
of	c
transport	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
strongly	c
disagree	c
with	c
the	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
that	c
local	c
film	c
production	c
itself	c
should	c
be	c
financially	c
supported	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
when	c
given	c
the	c
right	c
knowledge	c
young	c
people	c
can	c
not	c
grow	c
up	c
into	c
criminals	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
the	i
most	c
part	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
including	c
young	c
people	c
,	c
spend	c
their	c
free	c
time	c
indoors	c
,	i
it	c
is	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
they	i
forget	c
how	c
they	c
can	c
spend	c
their	c
time	c
in	c
outdoors	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
.	c
this	i
life	c
dtyle	i
has	c
had	c
influence	c
on	c
children	c
.	c

So	c
in	c
addition	c
people	c
who	c
produce	c
pirate	c
copies	c
should	c
be	c
punished	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
obvious	c
that	c
the	c
oldest	c
metro	c
system	c
is	c
the	c
oldest	c
metro	c
system	c
is	c
the	c
more	c
kilometres	c
of	c
route	c
it	c
has	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
the	c
vast	c
majority	c
of	c
scientist	c
prefer	c
to	c
carry	c
out	c
researches	i
in	c
the	c
private	c
companies	c
because	c
the	i
can	c
earn	i
much	c
more	c
money	c
for	c
theit	i
breakthroughs	c
and	c
can	i
use	c
all	c
the	c
methods	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
see	c
sports	c
as	c
the	c
best	c
option	c
,	c
but	c
many	c
disagree	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
I	c
strongly	c
believe	c
that	c
the	i
import	c
of	c
food	c
from	c
other	c
countries	c
is	c
necessary	c
for	c
the	i
country	c
.	c

People	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
strong	c
to	c
deal	c
with	c
everyday	c
stress	c
and	c
to	c
fight	c
with	c
enviromental	i
pollutions	c

Secondly	i
,	i
the	i
coping	i
of	i
infornation	i
without	i

is	i
restricted	i
by	i
law	i
If	c
people	c
do	c

,	c
the	c
other	c
laws	c
will	c
not	c
have	i
any	c
sence	i
for	c
them	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
find	c
it	c
extremely	c
important	c
that	c
we	c
surround	c
ourselves	c
with	c
beautiful	c
buildings	c
that	c
also	c
satisfy	c
the	c
needs	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
some	c
universities	c
or	c
colledges	i
has	c
special	c
specializations	c
,	c
which	c
can	c
connected	i
with	c
police	c
or	c
with	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
number	c

pepople	i
,	i
who	c

had	c
a	i
upward	c
trend	c
and	c
changed	c
at	c
aproximately	i
on	c
50	c
millions	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
achieve	c
this	c
goal	c
is	c
to	c
combine	c
this	c
way	c
with	c
other	c
aspects	c
of	c
governmental	c
and	c
individual	c
care	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c

the	c

has	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
drowback	i
of	c
using	c
pharmacy	c
to	c
improve	c
your	c
health	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
may	c
damage	c
one	c
part	c
of	c
your	c
common	c
health	c
when	c
you	c
heal	c
anether	i

It	c
is	c
interesting	c
to	c
note	c
that	c

The	c
idea	c
is	c
the	c
following	c
:	c
every	c
product	c
including	c
music	c
records	c
and	c

considers	i
in	c
its	c

half	c

the	c
18	c
-	c
29	c
year	c
old	c
age	c
group	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
clearly	c
unpopular	c
among	c
older	c
adults	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
watching	c
sports	c
is	c
definitely	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
fact	c
will	c
be	c
interesting	c
for	c
tourists	c
.	c

The	i
people	i
will	c
get	c
rebellious	c
if	c
the	c
government	c
takes	c
something	i
so	i
important	i
and	i
valuable	i
away	c
.	i

Despite	c
all	c
these	c
facts	c
,	c
I	c
consider	c
that	c
thinking	c
only	c
about	c
yourself	c
has	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

Internet	c
really	c
helps	c
people	c
to	c
become	c
those	c
who	c
they	c
wanted	i
to	c
be	c
and	c
every	c
kind	c
of	c
censorship	c
may	c
harm	c
that	c
atmospheree	i
.	c

They	c
are	c
tollerent	i
to	c
breaking	c
the	c
law	c
by	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
different	c
opinions	c
about	c
the	c
problem	c
of	c
child	i
raising	c
and	c
upbringing	c
,	c
but	c
both	c
have	c
strong	c
arguments	c
,	c
therefore	c
whether	i
the	i
main	i
features	i
of	i
child	i
's	i
character	i
are	i
developed	i
in	i
home	i
or	i
outside	i
is	i
still	i
a	i
question	i
of	i
a	i
debate	i

As	c
it	c
was	c
said	c
earlier	c
,	c
architecture	c
is	c
art	c

a	c
form	c
of	c
the	c
dialogue	c

,	c
aesthetics	c
and	c

,	c
it	c
is	c
place	c
where	c
people	c
meet	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
advertising	c
and	c
many	c
ways	c
of	c
distribution	c
of	c
both	c
are	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
reasons	c
of	c
the	c
crime	c
growth	c

Howewer	i
,	c
in	c
that	i
case	c
,	i
the	c
values	i
of	c
Australia	i
working	c
people	c
are	c
slightly	c
higher	c
.	c

And	c
not	c
even	c
the	c
career	c
of	c
a	c
good	c
athlet	i
can	c
be	c
ruin	c
after	c
such	c
mistakes	c

but	c
also	c
the	c

where	c

As	i
the	c
predictions	c
for	c
2050	c
,	c
the	c
percentage	c
of	c
15	c
-	c
59	c

will	c
increase	c
by	c
more	c

Not	c

many	c
people	c
use	c

Concluding	i

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
increasing	c

to	c
be	c
very	i
good	c
idea	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
my	c
group	c
has	c
12	c

12	c

-	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
convinient	i
for	c
some	c

to	c
make	i
us	c

different	c
small	c

for	c
pojects	i
or	c

so	c
on	c

Yet	c
,	c
we	c
can	c

that	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
in	i
the	c

of	c

In	c
that	c

there	c
is	c
a	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
criteria	c
for	c
university	c
to	i
accept	c
person	i
is	c
an	c
independant	i
exam	c
which	c
shows	c
the	c
level	c
of	c
knowledge	c
and	c
some	c
skills	c
which	c
are	c
necessary	c
for	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
profession	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
believe	c
that	c
this	c
goal	c
can	c
be	c
succeed	c
by	c
increasing	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
sports	c
facilities	c
.	c

Second	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
is	c
less	c
strict	c
.	c

But	c
what	c
the	c
pessimists	c
are	c
afraid	i
of	i
is	i
also	c
a	i
possible	c
scenario	c

However	c

different	c
points	c
of	c

have	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
exist	c

from	c

The	c
numbers	c
stayed	c
the	c
same	c

after	c
1980	c
they	c
started	c
to	c
increase	c
.	c

It	c
sounds	c
weird	i
but	c
i	i
am	c
sure	c
that	c
such	c
people	c
's	c
labour	c
does	c
not	c
depend	c
on	c
their	c
salaries	c
as	c
their	c
primary	c
principle	c
is	c
to	c
continue	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
world	c
better	c

We	c
import	c

quantity	c

goods	c
that	c
were	c
dellivered	i

were	c
very	c
heavy	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
why	c
they	c
were	c
rarely	c

Different	c

General	i
conclusion	c
to	c
the	c
graph	c
might	c
be	c
that	c
the	c
leading	c
network	c
keeps	c
its	c
strong	c
position	c
by	c
targeting	c
the	c
younger	c
audience	c

There	c
is	c
the	c
additional	c
factor	c
which	c
I	c
consider	c
as	c
the	c
second	c
reason	c
:	c
accessibility	i
of	c

that	c

that	c

Taking	c
a	c
gap	c

might	c
be	c
so	c
advantageous	c
for	c
youngsters	c
as	c
they	c
can	c
make	c
many	c
useful	c
contacts	c
with	c
people	c
while	c
working	c

simply	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
lenght	i
of	c

very	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
well	c

that	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
reasons	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
is	i
what	c
you	c
eat	c

Starting	c
with	c
North	c
America	c
's	c
statistics	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
stress	c
that	c
there	c
is	i
no	c
changes	c
in	c
unemployment	c
rate	c
between	c
2014	c
and	c
2015	c

When	c
we	c
have	c
not	c
enought	i
money	c
to	c
go	c
to	c

we	c
can	c
also	c
do	c
it	c
sitting	c
at	c

a	c

What	c
is	c
more	c

a	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
using	c
illegal	c
medicine	c
is	c
definitely	c
a	c
problem	c
nowadays	c

When	c
you	c

you	c
can	c
relax	c
due	c

But	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
identify	c
this	i

it	c

that	c

That	c

why	c

up	c

the	c
most	c

Science	c

there	c
are	c
some	c

have	c
no	c

some	c

Overall	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
evident	c
that	c
the	c
percentage	i
of	c
boys	i

who	c
suffered	c
from	c
obesety	i
was	c
growing	c
steadily	c

while	c
at	c

there	c
was	c

who	c

in	c
2005	c
in	c
comparison	c
to	c
1990	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
point	c
out	c
once	c
again	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
controversial	c
question	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
in	c
the	c
list	c
of	c
major	c
metro	c
is	c
Washington	c
DC	c
.	c

I	c
disagree	c
with	c
the	c
statement	c
because	c
arhitects	i
should	c
think	c
about	c
producing	c
purposes	c
and	i
apperaence	i
both	c
.	i

From	c
24,1	c
%	c
in	c
the	c

2000	c
to	c
as	c
high	c
as	c
42,3	c
%	c
projected	c
in	c
the	c
year	c
2050	c
.	c

Therefore	i
it	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
stage	i
of	c
the	c
socialization	c
of	c
students	c

As	c
it	c
is	c
evident	c
from	c

As	c
for	c

the	c
lack	c

than	c
the	c
one	c
with	c

They	c
are	c
completely	c
sure	c

that	c

want	c
to	c
destroy	c
their	c

and	c
they	c
try	c
to	c

only	c
10	c

On	c
the	c

,	c
the	c

who	c
held	c
a	c

than	i
the	c
level	c
of	c

with	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
people	c
who	c
involved	i

live	c
longer	c
and	c
healthier	c

Let	c
's	c
talk	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

From	i
one	i
hand	i
it	i
is	c
good	i
gift	c
for	c
them	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
can	c
think	c
about	c
them	i
life	c
,	c
career	c
and	c
other	c
things	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
the	c
reason	i
for	i
education	c
to	i
become	c
an	c
important	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

And	c
this	c
problem	c
is	c
still	c
very	c
actual	c
nowadays	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
30	c
-	c
49	i
age	i
category	i
,	c
they	c
prefer	c
facebook	i
too	c
,	c
because	c
the	i
percentage	i
of	i
this	i
category	i
ahe	i
people	i
is	i
73	i
per	i
cent	i
,	c
while	c
linkedln	i
and	c
instagram	i
consist	c
a	c
little	i
more	c
then	i
30	c
and	c
half	c
of	c
50	c
corespondently	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
fairly	i
to	c
claim	c
that	c
watching	c
sport	i
at	c
different	c
live	c
matches	c
is	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
interaction	c
among	c
people	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
work	c
of	c
producer	i
or	c
musician	i
is	c
also	c
a	c
labour	c
,	c
a	c
hard	c
labour	c
,	c
and	c
this	c
hard	c
labour	c
must	c
be	c
paid	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
USA	c
the	c
percentage	c
dropped	c
from	c
about	c
40	c
%	c
in	c
1980	c
to	c
20	c
%	c
in	c
1995	c
.	c

Remembering	c
this	c
pivotal	c
principe	i
will	c
make	c
either	c
producers	c
and	c
musicians	c
'	c
or	c
Internet	c
users	c
'	c
lives	c
easier	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
teachers	c
and	c
parents	c
can	c
help	c
their	c
children	c
cope	c
with	c
these	c
problems	c
by	c
educating	c
them	c
from	c
the	c
very	c
early	c
age	c
.	c

But	c
as	c
for	c
me	c
I	c
can	c
not	c
be	c
totally	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
statement	c
.	c

Also	c
even	c
\"	c
harm	c
food	c
\"	c
is	c
useful	c
in	c
some	c
situations	c
.	c

The	c
demand	c
is	c
not	c
stable	i
so	c
the	c
using	i
of	c
electricity	c
increase	i
from	c
3500	i
to	c
45000	c
units	c
.	c

But	c
personally	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
some	c
laws	c
that	c
would	c
have	c
and	i
effect	c
on	c
the	c
decrease	c
of	c
polition	i
are	c
needed	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
their	c
choice	c
can	c
be	c
the	c
main	c
issue	c
that	c
indisieates	i
whole	c
future	c
life	c
.	c

Due	c
to	c
this	c
fact	c
,	c
we	c
got	c
different	c
characteristics	c
in	c
the	c
begining	i
of	c
our	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
it	c

This	c
essay	c
will	c
eximene	i
different	c
points	c
of	c
view	c
on	c
the	c
free	i
art	c
and	c
my	c
opinion	c
on	c
the	c
these	i
theme	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
if	c
artists	c
lie	c
,	c
people	c
will	c
protest	c
against	c
the	c
government	c
,	c
which	c
let	c
such	c
activities	c
.	c

This	c
argession	i
would	c
break	c
the	c
social	c
structure	c
,	i
all	c
society	c
from	c
inside	i
and	c
even	c
become	c
a	c
reason	c
of	c
new	i
conflict	c
between	c
people	c
,	c
social	c
groaps	i
or	c
even	c
the	i
contries	i
.	c

One	c
my	i
school	c
classmate	i
has	c
even	c
chosen	c
the	c
faculty	c
on	c
his	c
second	c
year	c
at	i
university	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
situation	c
is	c
different	c
with	c
the	c
reason	c
\"	c
for	c
interest	c
\"	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
someone	c
says	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
easily	i
only	i
when	i
you	i
talking	i
about	i
it	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
peole	i
who	c
are	c
against	c
this	c
idea	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
in	c
USSR	i
there	c
was	c
a	c
strong	c
censorship	c
at	c
every	c
stage	c
including	c
art	c
,	c
thereby	c
those	c
who	c
did	c
n't	c
follow	c
the	c
rules	c
were	c
punished	c
dramatically	i
.	c

A	c
person	c
can	c
not	c
live	c
alone	c
because	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
needs	c
not	c
only	c
to	c
communicate	c
with	c
somebody	c
but	c
also	c
needs	c
to	c
recieve	i
help	c
or	c
to	c
share	c
it	c
with	c
others	c
.	c

But	c
clearly	c
it	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
goals	c
on	i
lives	c
of	c
almost	c
everybody	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
few	c
women	c
,	i
desiring	c
to	c
study	c
engeneering	i
,	i
however	c
this	c
question	i
is	c
quite	c
attractive	c
for	c
men	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	i
second	c
place	c
on	c
the	c
date	i
was	c
located	c
people	c
in	c
ages	i
60	i
and	c
more	c
years	c
.	i

Such	c
people	c
wish	i
for	c
opportunities	c
to	c
participate	c
in	c
as	c
many	c
activities	c
as	c
possible	c
and	c
are	c
usually	c
dissatisfied	c
when	c
they	c
do	c
not	c
get	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
fulfill	c
their	c
needs	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
let	c
us	c
think	c
it	c
over	c
.	c

From	c
one	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
human	c
rights	c
allow	c
ant	c
student	c
to	c
choose	c
what	c
subject	c
he	c
/	c
she	c
wants	c
to	c
study	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
so	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
numbers	c
of	c
male	c
and	c
female	c
in	c
every	c
area	c
is	c
equal	c
.	c

Furthermore	i
this	c
animals	i
can	c
walk	c
on	c
the	c
beach	c
thanks	i
for	i
windy	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
belief	c
that	c
governments	c
will	c
not	c
introduve	i
laws	c
to	c
reduce	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
air	c
travel	c
for	c
business	c
and	c
leisure	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
examples	i
of	i
a	i
sort	c
of	i
an	i
other	i
situations	i
.	c

In	c
this	c
type	c
of	c
situations	c
people	c
should	c
make	c
up	c
your	c
mind	c
and	c
do	c
their	c
best	c
to	c
reach	c
the	c
aim	c
.	c

The	c
highest	c
percentage	c
of	c
people	c
is	c
in	c
the	c
age	c
category	c
of	c
18	c
-	c
29	c
and	c
they	c
prefer	c
to	c
pass	c
the	c
time	c
in	c
Facebook	c
,	c
while	c
the	c
lowest	c
number	c
of	c
people	c
are	c
those	c
who	c
are	c
65	c
+	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
they	c
use	c
Instagram	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
music	c
CDs	c
are	c
growing	c
in	c
price	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
buy	c
them	c
only	c
if	c
you	c
're	c
a	c
big	c
fan	c
of	c
a	c
curuent	i
album	c
or	c
band	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
driver	c
in	c
subway	i
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
man	c
while	c
women	c
are	c
considerably	i
not	c
able	i
to	c
do	c
this	c
work	c
.	c

Overall	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
trend	c
is	c
the	c
decrease	c
of	c
using	c
print	i
books	c
while	c
rise	c
of	c
eBook	c
usage	c
is	c
noted	c
.	c

Why	c
would	c
people	c
ignore	c
such	c
a	c
marvelous	c
option	c
?	c

Nowadays	c
the	c
increasing	c
appliance	c
of	c
illegal	c
drugs	c
in	c
sport	c
is	c
an	c
acute	c
problem	c
.	c

Also	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
smallest	c
rate	c
was	c
in	c
South	c
Asia	c
.	c

By	c
contrast	c
,	c
South	c
Asia	c
has	i
the	c
lowest	c
level	c
of	c
3,9	c
%	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
this	c
generally	i
true	c
but	c
not	c
always	i
If	c
it	c
is	c
undeniable	i
,	i
that	c
some	c
experience	c
of	c
mankind	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
very	c
helpful	c
and	c
even	c
essential	c
.	c
people	c
in	c
contemprory	i
world	c
can	c
hardly	c
imagine	c
ther	i
lives	c
without	c
machines	c
.	c

The	c
unemployment	c
rate	c
in	c
the	c
Middle	c
East	c
falled	i
dramatically	c
from	c
11	c
%	c
in	c
2014	c
to	c
9,6	c
%	c
in	c
2015	c
.	c

About	c
70	c
%	c
of	c
males	i
kept	i
it	c
.	c

Less	c
severe	c
gun	c
control	c
policies	c
and	c
the	c
abolition	c
of	c
capital	c
punishment	c
in	c
many	c
states	c
question	c
the	c
authority	c
of	c
the	c
government	c
for	c
the	c
common	c
people	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
this	c
case	c
another	c
,	c
complicated	c
question	c
arises	c
-	c
is	c
this	c
really	c
art	c
?	c

I	c
firmly	c
believe	c
,	c
that	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
,	c
on	i
technical	c
faculties	i
,	c
where	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
students	c
are	c
men	c
,	c
equal	c
number	i
of	c
female	i
can	c
make	c
the	c
study	c
more	c
interesting	c
and	c
productive	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
least	c
percentage	c
of	c
females	c
chose	c
skilled	c
vakation	i
diploma	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
go	c
back	c
in	c
time	c
to	c
find	c
arguements	i
for	c
this	c
statement	c
.	c

The	c
presented	c
graph	c
shows	c
an	c
unemployment	c
rate	c
in	c
different	c
world	c
regions	c
(	c
N.	c
Africa	c
,	c
Middle	i
East	i
,	c
European	c
Union	i
,	c
Latin	c
America	c
,	c
S.	c
Asia	c
)	c
in	c
2014	c
and	c
in	c
2015	c
.	c

Sportmen	i
and	c
other	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
sure	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
fair	c
game	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
useful	c
to	c
filter	c
what	c
we	c
read	c
,	c
watch	c
or	c
listen	c
to	c
or	c
to	c
take	c
only	c
necessary	i
information	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
at	c
the	c
current	c
moment	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
some	c
critics	c
believe	c
that	c
people	c
should	c
have	c
free	c
access	c
to	c
music	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
goverments	i
should	c
put	c
urgent	c
problems	c
first	c
and	c
pay	c
much	c
more	c
attention	c
to	c
them	c
than	c
to	c
space	c
exploration	c
.	c

These	c
restrictions	c
should	c
not	c
be	c
similar	c
to	c
censorship	c
.	c

Though	c
only	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
non	c
-	c
printed	c
books	c
are	c
expected	c
to	c
overgrow	c
the	c
print	c
by	c
2018	c
.	c

Parents	c
and	c
teachers	c
should	c
just	c
pay	c
enough	c
attention	c
to	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
that	c
only	c
unforeign	i
products	c
have	c
healtful	i
vitamins	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

People	c
downloads	i
copies	c
of	c
films	c
in	i
their	c
computers	c
,	c
but	c
the	i
can	c
often	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
,	i
because	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
films	c
look	i
like	i
so	c
good	c
and	c
cool	c
on	c
the	i
big	i
ekran	i
.	c

To	c
start	c
with	c
,	c
we	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
globalized	c
world	c
where	c
people	c
travel	c
to	c
different	c
countries	c
regularly	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
clear	c
that	c
London	c
metropolitan	c
was	c
opened	c
much	c
earlier	c
than	c
other	i
,	c
and	c
nowadays	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
biggest	c
one	c
(	c
304	c
km	c
of	c
route	c
)	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
there	i
are	c
people	c
who	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
their	c
day	c
without	c
watching	c
some	c
matches	c
or	c
rings	c
of	c
their	c
favourite	c
team	c
or	c
sportsman	c
.	c

The	c
similar	c
tendency	c
can	c
be	c
revealed	c
in	c
bachelor	c
's	c
degree	c
,	c
however	c
the	c
proportion	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
female	c
dominated	c
,	c
55	c
%	c
to	c
45	c
%	c
aproximately	i
.	c

And	c
Facebook	c
remains	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
successful	c
projects	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
with	c
its	c
incredibly	c
wide	c
spread	c
.	c

Not	c
paying	c
attention	c
to	c
other	c
countries	c
and	c
concentrating	c
only	c
on	c
yours	c
can	c
lead	c
to	c
horrible	c
consequences	c
like	c
famines	c
,	c
citizen	i
wars	c
and	c
etc	c
.	c

As	i
for	i
me	i
,	i
the	i
main	i
thing	i
is	i
that	i
people	i
are	i
born	i
with	i
potencial	i
,	i
but	i
they	i
are	i
not	i
equal	i
it	c
is	i
like	i
cars	c
,	i
some	c
of	c
them	c
have	c
more	c
horse	c
power	c
then	c
others	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
nothing	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
faced	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
situations	c
when	c
I	c
knew	c
a	c
person	c
in	c
childhood	c
and	c
was	i
friends	c
with	c
him	c
or	c
her	c
.	c

We	c
saw	c
many	c
Paraolympics	i
champions	c
not	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
and	i
we	c
could	c
be	c
motivated	c
by	c
their	c
self	c
-	c
confidence	c
,	c
being	c
ambitions	i
and	c
being	c
best	i
even	c
without	c
arms	c
and	c
legs	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
young	c
men	c
spent	c
approximately	c
282	c
minutes	c
on	c
sport	c
,	c
while	c
those	c
who	c
were	c
over	c
75	c
years	c
old	c
spent	c
only	c
29	c
minutes	c

still	c

high	c

The	c
crime	c
activity	c
among	c
younger	c
generation	c
is	c
the	i
issue	c
of	c
concern	c
in	c
many	c
countries	c

Using	c
this	c
system	c
boys	c
have	c
more	i
complicated	i
competition	c
than	c
girls	c

From	c
the	c
other	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
come	c
up	c
with	c
the	i
decision	i
that	c
people	c
who	c
leak	c
such	c
information	c
are	c
criminals	c
as	i
their	c
main	c
purpose	c
is	c
not	c
download	i
a	c
film	c
and	c
spend	c
their	c
evening	c
sitting	c
on	c
a	c
sofa	c
watching	c
it	c
and	c
just	c
having	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

While	c
some	c
people	c
claim	c
,	i
that	c
politicians	c
should	c
be	c
concerned	c
about	c
the	c
issues	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
is	c
facing	c
,	c
others	c
insist	c
that	c
the	c
government	c
should	c
only	c
be	c
offering	c
support	c
to	c
the	c
citizens	c
of	c
their	c
own	c
country	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
illegal	i
action	c
to	c
share	c
the	c

musical	c
files	c
that	c
have	c
a	c
copyright	c

The	c
given	c
graph	c

information	c
about	c

,	c
Middle	i
East	i
,	c
European	c
Union	i
,	c
Latin	c
America	c
and	c
South	c
Asia	c
in	c
2014	c
and	c
2015	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
few	i
issues	c
that	c
show	c
the	c
link	c
between	c
listed	i
thights	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
here	i
should	c
be	c
a	c
balance	c
between	c
opinions	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
well	c
known	c
that	c
children	c
,	c
that	c
grow	c
up	c
in	c
half	i
families	c
sometimes	c
have	c
lack	i
of	c
happiness	c
than	i
people	c
from	c
normal	i
ones	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
the	c
cultural	c
industry	c
would	i
have	i
to	c
find	c
a	c
new	c
way	c
to	c
adopt	i
and	c
to	c
remain	c
profitable	c
in	c
the	c
fast	c
changing	c
conditions	c
of	c
the	c
internet	c
piracy	c
.	c

In	c
Brazil	c
also	i
it	i
is	c
very	c
high	c
temperature	c
.	c

If	c
a	c
person	c
grows	c
up	c
in	c
a	c
good	c
conditions	c
with	i
care	c
and	c
love	c
,	c
the	c
person	c
will	c
behave	c
adequatelly	i
.	c

Then	c
the	c
German	c
example	c
indicates	c
more	c
calm	c
,	c
changes	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
it	c
can	i
be	i
caused	c
by	c
financial	c
crisis	c
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
that	c
mass	c
media	c
would	c
explode	c
;	c
they	c
wrote	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
articles	c
about	c
this	c
phenomenon	c
.	c

The	c
globalization	c
should	c
be	c
used	c
carefully	c
,	c
but	c
should	c
not	c
be	c
ignored	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
past	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
types	c
of	c
laws	c
that	c
were	c
censoring	c
all	c
pieces	c
of	c
art	c
that	c
was	c
done	c

Secondly	c
,	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
adress	i
users	c
coherentely	i
,	c
allowing	c
them	c
to	c
navigate	c
their	c
works	c
and	c
enter	c
the	c
dialogue	c
that	c
these	c
artists	c
are	c
seeking	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
education	c
sector	c
more	i
people	c
worked	c

at	c
the	c

that	i
is	c
approximately	c
equal	c
to	c
125000	c
and	c
just	c
up	i
the	c
number	c
of	c

in	c
this	c

at	c
the	c

From	c
the	c
another	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
twice	c
bigger	i
amount	c
of	c
woman	i
have	c
an	c

They	c
like	c
leisure	c
time	c
and	c
do	c
not	c
waste	c
much	c
time	c
on	c
their	c
jobs	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
have	c
not	c
got	c
much	c
money	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
both	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
which	i
I	c
will	c
illustrate	c
for	c
expressing	c
my	c
own	c
opinion	c

to	c

From	c
this	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
second	i
chart	c
is	c
more	c
passive	c
:	c
average	c
temperature	c
values	c
in	c
winter	c
and	c
in	c

are	c
very	c
close	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

It	c
's	i
gives	c
not	c
to	i
much	c
from	c
one	c
phone	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
lige	i
gull	c

the	c
number	i

is	c
really	c

The	c

Firstly	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
Middle	c
East	c
percentage	i
of	c
people	c
without	c
job	i
plunged	c
from	c
11	c
%	c
to	c
9,6	c
%	c
.	c

So	c
how	c
can	c
governments	i
and	c
political	c
organizations	c
control	c
it	c
?	c

Equally	c
,	c
in	c
1985	c
the	c
obesity	c
rates	c
were	c
the	c
lowest	c
in	c
comparsion	i
to	c
2005	c
,	c
where	i
the	c
girls	i
illustrate	i
only	c
12	c
percent	c
,	c
while	c
boys	c
a	i
little	c
less	c
-	c
11	c
percent	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
several	c
possible	c
causes	c
of	c
this	c
development	i
,	c
but	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
is	c
obviously	c
the	c
spread	c
of	c
computer	c
games	c
.	c

The	c
dashes	c
line	c
is	c
closely	c
similar	c
to	c
the	c
thin	c

but	c
has	c
differences	c
in	c
some	c
parts	c
.	c

In	c
2000	c
population	i
of	c
15	i
to	i
59	i
years	i
people	c
has	i
61,6	c
%	c
and	i
will	c
drop	c
to	c
46,2	c
%	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
modern	c
technologies	c
can	c
not	c
only	c
damage	c
us	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
help	c
to	c
reduce	c
some	c
diseases	c
,	c
with	c
or	c
without	c
technologies	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
health	c
problems	c
,	c
but	c
our	c
health	c
depends	c
on	c
us	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
do	c
sport	c
proparly	i
,	c
they	c
tend	c
to	c
use	c
supplements	c
,	c
which	c
can	c
improve	c
their	c
results	c
faster	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
it	c
would	c
have	c
bad	c
impact	c
on	c
health	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
this	c
case	c
is	c
not	c
rare	c
nowadays	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
essential	c
to	c
realize	c
that	c
provoding	i
support	i
to	i
the	i
poor	i
population	i
of	i
other	i
countries	i
the	c
goverment	i
will	c

different	c
awful	c
problems	c
with	c
body	c
and	c
eyes	c
,	c
even	c
blindness	i
.	c

In	c
conclution	i
I	i
want	c
to	c
say	c
,	i
that	c
appearence	i
of	c
buildings	c
play	i
a	c
vital	c
role	c
in	c
developing	c
of	c

of	i

and	i
I	c
hope	c

that	c

will	c
pay	c

to	c
this	c
fact	c

We	c

What	c
I	c
mean	c
is	c
that	c
children	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
memory	c
and	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
enough	c
to	c
make	c
lessons	c
attractive	c
and	c
funny	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
children	c
will	c
be	c
interested	c
in	c
them	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
Dali	c
,	c
Piccaso	i
,	c
Shagal	c
,	c
Shelkovski	i
and	c
other	c
famous	c
artists	c
that	c
made	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
the	c
primary	c
good	c
delivered	c
by	c
rail	c
is	c
metal	i
,	c
making	c
the	c
third	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
transportations	i

Besides	c
,	c
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
freedom	c
of	c
expression	c
by	c
creative	c
people	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
question	c
:	c
why	c
can	c
only	c
talanted	i
artists	c
use	c
this	c
freedom	c
?	c

To	c
draw	c
a	c
conclusion	c
,	c
the	c
data	c
of	c
all	c
countries	c
changed	c
,	c
and	c
China	c
prevaluates	i
on	c
other	c
countries	c
,	c
espesially	i
on	c
Sweden	c
,	c
which	c
has	i
the	c
opposite	c
data	c
.	c

To	c
draw	c
the	c
conclusion	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
dates	i
of	c
employer	c
support	c
depended	c
of	i
reason	c
for	c
study	i
according	c
.	c

Thus	i
art	c
should	c
be	c
explored	c
accordingly	c
in	c
all	c
shapes	c
and	c
forms	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
for	c
modern	i
world	c
when	c
young	c
people	c
tend	c
to	c
commit	c
crimes	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
commonly	c
known	c
that	c
music	c
celebrities	c
and	c
people	c
who	c
produce	c
film	c
suffers	c
from	c
illigal	i
copies	c
of	c
their	c
act	c
on	c
the	c
Internet	c

To	c
look	c
at	c
the	c
chart	c
in	c
more	c
detail	c
,	c
China	c
,	c
with	i
almost	i
90	i
%	i
of	i
its	i
energy	i
produced	i
by	i
fossil	i
fuels	i
reached	c
the	c
top	c
in	c
2015	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
situations	c
outside	c
the	c
house	c
where	c
other	c
people	c
may	c
change	c
the	c
way	c
of	c
a	c
child	c
thinking	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
government	i
have	c
no	c
possibilities	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
is	c
really	c
important	c
for	c
people	c
and	c
what	c
they	c
are	c
concerned	c
about	c

Today	i
it	i
has	i
been	i

enormous	i

differen	i
factories	i

which	c
are	c
extremely	c
dangerous	c

means	c
that	c
they	c

Many	c

says	i
that	c
the	c
big	c

the	c

some	c

that	c

To	c

it	c

considerably	c

It	c
is	c
widely	c
argued	c
that	c

that	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c

this	c
is	c
not	c

I	c
totally	c
disagree	c
with	c
this	c
type	c
of	c
politics	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
think	c
,	c
that	c

people	c

a	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
there	c
are	i
a	c

To	c
prevent	c
this	c

the	c

should	c
raise	c

India	c
had	c
the	c

I	c
personally	c
disagree	c
with	c
that	i
statement	c
and	c
believe	c
that	c
governments	c
should	c
provide	c
help	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
nations	c
globally	c

In	c
comparison	c
to	c
the	c

we	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
that	c

of	c

These	c

suppress	c

sometimes	c
even	c
do	c
not	c

that	c
it	i
is	i
not	c
original	c

they	c
pay	c
money	c

get	c
a	c
bad	c

an	c

Even	c
though	c

a	c

in	c

can	c
be	c
observed	c
,	c
borrowing	c

remained	c
the	c

reason	c
to	c
go	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
sector	c
\"	c
Services	c

has	c
a	c
huge	c
popularity	c
in	c
both	c
countries	c
while	i
the	c

on	i
the	c

As	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
from	c
the	c

the	c

It	c
is	c
it	c

that	c
our	c

our	c
first	i

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
such	c
an	c
opportunity	c
should	c
be	c
given	c
to	c
people	c
of	i
every	c
country	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
up	c
to	c
them	c
to	c
decide	c
whether	c
to	c
postpone	c
a	i
higher	c
education	c
or	c
to	c
begin	c
it	c
immediately	c
after	c

Also	c

do	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c

to	c
advertise	c

As	c
everybody	c
knows	c
,	c
nowadays	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
tendency	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
world	c
globalized	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	i
country	i
's	c
climate	c
is	c
the	c
main	c
factor	c
for	c
good	i
agricultural	c
policy	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
point	i
of	c
view	c
,	c
that	c
musicians	c
and	c
film	c
producers	c
suffer	c
from	c
pirate	c
copping	i
of	c
songs	i
and	c

so	c
they	c
lose	c
a	c

I	c
agree	c
that	c
some	c

should	c
have	c
time	c
community	c
service	c
because	c
,	c
for	c

,	c
when	c

To	c

we	c
can	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
both	c
views	c
are	c
equally	c
popular	c
among	c
different	c
people	c

but	c
personally	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
not	i
anything	i
more	c
important	c
than	c
a	i

still	c
go	i

people	c
have	c
more	c
access	c

poets	c

Firstly	c
,	c
according	c
to	c

all	c

Every	c

wants	c
to	c
be	c
happy	c

To	c
illustrate	c
this	c
example	i
,	c
one	c
can	c
consider	c
delevoping	i
countries	c
that	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
even	c
to	c
solve	c
their	c
own	c
problems	i
and	c
for	c
them	c
it	c
is	c
extremely	c
irrational	c
to	c
spend	c
it	c
on	c
other	c
countries	c
'	c
issues	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
functional	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
planning	c
could	c
not	c
be	c
denied	c
as	c
an	c
important	c
one	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
recently	c
Germany	c
has	c
provided	c
Syrian	c
refugees	c
with	c
shelters	c
in	i
its	c
own	c
territory	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
belive	i
that	c
these	c
facilities	c
and	c
opportunities	c
are	c
vitaly	i
important	c
for	c
our	c
health	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
by	c
2050	c
both	c
countries	c
will	c
have	c
older	c
population	c
compared	i
with	i
2000	c

people	c
have	c
different	i
point	c

Whereas	c
,	c
if	c

copy	c
is	c
down	i
loaded	i

musicians	c

producers	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
paid	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
interesting	c
point	c
:	c
statistic	i
shows	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
too	c
much	i
people	c
of	c
40	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
above	c
,	c
who	c
attended	c
this	c

I	c
mean	i
do	c
not	c

raise	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
we	c
deffinately	i
should	c
use	c
air	c
transport	c
less	c
,	c
sinse	i
it	c
pollutes	c
air	c
and	c
causes	i
to	c
huger	i
enviromental	i
problems	c
.	c

Many	c
of	c
them	c
consider	i
that	c
we	c
should	c
to	c
aim	c
to	c
import	c
because	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
countries	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
opportunities	c
to	c
produce	c
the	i
food	c
and	c
they	c
need	c
to	i
help	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
obvious	c
answer	c
,	c
that	c
sportmen	i
must	c
be	c
panished	i
,	c
neverthe	i
less	c
,	c
the	c
tough	c
cross	c
on	c

can	c
not	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
good	c
,	c
when	c
all	i
of	c
your	c
ration	i
growing	c
on	c
your	c
garden	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
opinion	c
is	c
in	c
modern	c
world	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
possible	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	i
common	c
statement	c
of	c
many	c
people	c
and	c
a	c
fair	c
one	c
at	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
mean	c
that	c
only	c
clear	c
,	c
hard	c
-	c
working	c
and	c
open	c
-	c
minded	c
students	c
should	c
be	c
accepted	c

In	c
the	c
last	c
decades	c
children	c
had	i
less	c

with	c
their	c

At	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
in	c
2000	c
year	c
,	c
in	c
Italy	c
the	c
most	i

The	c

people	c
believe	i
that	c
use	i
of	c
modern	c

is	c
harmful	c
for	c
our	c
health	c

We	c
may	c
conclude	c
that	c
they	i
are	c
similar	c
as	c
both	c
are	c
equal	c
(	c
both	c
show	i
the	c
rate	i
of	c
unemployment	c
of	c
12,5	c
%	c
)	c
.	c

The	c
unemployment	c
here	c
increased	c
from	c
7,5	i
to	c
7,9	i
(	i
these	c
two	c
numbers	c
show	i
the	c
same	c

that	i
previous	c
ones	c
)	c

A	c
great	c
number	c
of	c
people	c
suppose	i
that	c
children	c
's	c
decisions	c
,	i
which	c
they	c
make	c
outside	c
their	c
home	c
are	c
better	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
add	c
that	c
travellings	i
that	c
give	c
us	c
new	c
impressions	c
and	c
good	c
education	c
can	c
not	c
happen	c
without	c
money	c
.	c

Thus	c
,	c
such	c
measures	c
would	i
not	c
prevent	c
inequality	c
but	c
support	c
it	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
i	i
strongly	c
belive	i
that	c

relationship	c
built	c
child	c
's	c
character	c

more	c
than	c
anything	c

Hence	c
,	c
the	c
economy	c
of	c
this	c
country	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
stable	c
economies	c
of	c
the	c

Both	c
points	c

My	c
first	c
argument	c
is	c
that	c
if	c
you	c

to	c

the	c

faster	c
you	c
need	c
to	c

it	c
was	c
considered	i

that	c
women	c
should	c
not	c
learn	c
such	c
sciense	i
as	c
physics	c
or	c

;	c
so	c

The	c
rest	i

Happiness	c
is	c
the	c
concept	c
which	c
just	c
goes	c
out	c
of	c
an	c
rationality	c
so	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
we	c
can	c
not	c
put	c
the	c
feeling	c
of	c
being	c
happy	c
in	c

It	c
helps	c
us	c
to	c

The	c
problem	c
for	c

that	c

what	c

it	i
was	c
5,9	c
%	c
in	c
2014	c
and	c
2015	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
from	c
the	c
chart	c
that	c
nearly	c
90	c
%	c
of	c
males	c
held	c
a	c

the	c

is	i
higher	c
that	c
male	i
ones	c

Meanwhile	c
,	c
the	c
less	c
popular	c

for	c
both	c

is	i
learning	c
about	c

It	c
may	c
prevent	c

There	c
were	c

examples	c
in	c

and	c
it	c
happened	c
becouse	i
of	c
wrong	i

policy	c
of	c

It	c
is	c
clear	c
from	c
the	c

that	c
the	c

The	c

That	c
means	c
that	c
every	c

not	i
only	c
harms	i

illegal	c
actions	c

also	c
stimulates	c
the	c
crime	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
increase	c
of	i
the	c
sport	i

can	c
be	c
the	c
cause	c
of	c
the	c
new	c
trends	c
such	c
as	c
,	c
for	c

,	c
healthy	c
lifestyle	c

Firstly	c
,	c
they	c
believe	c
that	c
now	c
,	i
when	i
we	i
are	i
living	i
in	i
the	i
post	i
-	i
industrial	i
world	i
we	c
should	c
have	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
copy	c
and	c
share	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
we	c
get	c
.	c

Only	c
a	c
half	c

interwiers	i

In	c
this	c

people	c
will	c
eat	c
usual	c

Many	c
of	c
my	c

In	c
contrast	c
,	c
the	c

is	c
a	c

where	c
people	c
can	c
find	c
all	c
they	c
want	c
and	c
absolutly	i
free	c

Without	c
any	c
researches	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
behaviour	c
of	c
individs	i
depends	c
on	c
their	c
family	c
and	c
people	c
surround	c
him	c

I	i
m	i
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
the	c
beauty	c
is	c
important	c

however	c
,	c
the	c
quality	c

it	c

To	c

up	c

from	c
both	c

we	c
can	c

that	c

if	c

it	c

it	c
can	c
be	c

that	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
although	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
essential	c
for	c
our	c
live	i
it	i
is	c
highly	c
recommended	c
to	c

the	c

For	i
this	c
opinion	c

not	c

Overall	c
,	c
I	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
opinion	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
believe	c
in	c
it	c

Maybe	c
punishing	c

partly	c
agree	c
with	c

a	i

The	c

The	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
economic	c
problems	c
a	c
person	c
gets	c
fired	c
from	c
job	c

still	c
has	c
his	c

her	c
fixed	c

probably	c

at	c

from	c

point	c
out	c
that	c

To	c
tell	c
the	c
truth	c

I	c
do	c
not	c

,	i
for	i

people	c
are	c

some	i

Some	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
sportsmen	c
that	c
use	c

should	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
compete	c
in	c
professional	c

for	c
a	c

while	c
others	c
think	c
that	c
they	i
should	c
be	c
banned	c
from	c
competing	c
for	c
good	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
each	c
person	c
is	c
connected	c
with	c
art	c

But	c
there	c
are	c
people	c
who	c
dedicated	c
all	c
their	c
life	c
for	c
pictures	c
,	c
music	c
or	c
sculpture	c

Many	c
companies	c
today	i
carry	c
out	c
their	c
own	c
surveys	c
,	i
for	c
instance	c
,	c
in	c
economics	c
,	i
where	c
the	i
data	c
are	c
constantly	c
changing	c

Likewise	c
,	c
non	c
-	c
metallic	c
minerals	c
and	c
metals	c
transported	c
by	c
road	c
had	c
also	c
approximately	c

We	c
can	c
even	c
see	c
that	c

Despite	c
average	i

still	c
bigger	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
there	c
should	c
be	c
a	c
list	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
EU	c
,	c
the	c
unemployment	c
rate	c
for	c
this	c

had	c
not	c

7,5	c

Many	c
of	c
them	c
suppose	c
that	c
the	c
increase	c
of	c
prison	c

could	c
help	c

I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
describe	c
it	c
and	c
summarise	c
the	c
information	c
it	c

For	c
this	c
reason	c
the	i

accept	c
numbers	i

who	c
want	c
to	c

Transporting	c
goods	c
by	c

are	c
similar	c
in	c
some	c
aspects	c

Generally	c

all	c

But	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c

,	c
there	c
are	c
as	c
many	c

But	c
also	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
clearly	c

from	c
the	c

In	c

should	c
say	c
that	c
the	c

can	c
be	c
more	c

To	c
summarize	c

there	c
are	c
different	c
views	c
about	c
how	c

a	c

of	c
the	c

in	c
North	c
Africa	c
and	c
South	c

remains	c
constant	c

it	c
also	c
may	c
be	c
a	c

On	c

easily	c

not	c
provide	c
other	c

There	c
is	c
an	c
opinion	c
that	c

in	c

should	c
produce	c
as	c
much	c

as	c
their	c

and	c

.	c

In	c
the	c
essay	c
will	i
be	i
given	i
the	i
main	i
point	i
of	i
the	i
problems	i
,	c
caused	c
by	c
new	c
technologies	c
and	i
will	c
be	i
given	i
solution	c
.	i

On	c
the	c
whole	c
I	i
argue	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
universities	c
should	c
decide	c
weather	i
to	c
allow	c
or	c
not	c
each	c
given	c
student	c
to	c
study	c
in	c
the	c
certain	c
subject	c
judging	c
not	c
by	c
their	c
gender	c
but	c
by	c
their	c
knowledge	c
and	c
eagerness	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
clear	c
that	c
we	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
of	c
high	c
-	i
technologies	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
gadgets	c
became	i
a	c
part	c
of	c
human	i
's	c
everyday	c
life	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
not	c
all	c
people	c
have	c
got	c
enough	c
money	c
for	c
viviting	i
sports	c
clubs	c
.	c

And	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
number	c
of	c
sportsmens	i
want	c
to	c
receive	c
drugs	c
for	c
success	c
in	c
competitions	c
.	c

Therefore	i
it	c
is	c
crucially	c
important	c
to	c
import	c
goods	c
.	c

The	c
advert	c
brings	c
huge	c
money	c
,	c
so	c
the	c
authors	c
can	c
earn	c
money	c
.	c

The	c
data	c
were	c
collected	c
in	c
1999	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
choice	c
in	c
favour	c
of	c
money	c
will	c
mean	c
the	c
lost	i
of	c
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
opportunities	c
that	c
life	c
can	c
offer	c
.	c

The	c
creative	c
artists	c
must	c
be	c
given	c
the	c
freedom	c
to	c
express	c
their	c
good	c
ideas	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
to	c
improve	c
public	c
health	c
with	c
help	c
of	c
all	c
available	c
ways	c
,	c
especially	c
,	c
with	c
help	c
of	c
sport	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
essay	c
I	c
will	c
argue	c
on	c
whether	c
this	c
change	c
is	c
required	c
or	c
whether	c
art	c
serves	c
a	c
certain	c
purpose	c
in	c
the	c
creator	i
and	c
in	c
the	c
society	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
immediately	c

opinion	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
musicians	c

gain	c
very	c
large	c
amounts	c

they	c
would	c

Based	c
on	c

my	c
opinion	c
is	c
that	c

as	c
out	c

For	c

there	c
are	c

that	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
that	c
the	c

greater	c

the	c

Some	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
people	c
should	c
be	c
allowed	c
to	c
express	c
themselves	c
because	c
all	c
people	c
have	c
freedom	c
and	c
can	c
do	c
everything	c
to	c
say	c
something	c
to	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
depends	c
on	c
the	c
way	c
they	c
show	c
their	c
thoughts	c
and	c
feelings	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
long	i
story	c
short	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
add	c
that	c
creative	c
artists	c
should	c
be	c
given	c
the	c
freedom	c
to	c
express	c
their	c
ideas	c
but	c
there	c
should	c
be	c
morall	i
restrictions	c
for	c
them	c

I	c
thin	i
that	c
that	c
goal	c
can	c
be	c
achieved	c
only	c
by	c
a	c
complex	c
system	c
of	c
actions	c
of	c
a	c
government	c
,	c
but	c
increasing	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
sport	i

will	c
definitely	c
influence	c
on	c
it	c
in	c
some	c
way	c

This	c
rule	c
also	c
concerns	c

besides	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
free	c
to	c
choose	c
any	c
subject	c
they	c
want	c

This	c
may	c
be	c
caused	c
by	c
things	c
like	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
find	c
restavration	i
one	i
of	c
the	c
major	c
problems	c
nowadays	c
.	c

Listening	c
to	c
music	c
,	c
playing	c
any	c
instruments	c
or	c
at	c
leas	c
going	c
to	c
theatre	i
would	c
be	c
more	c
than	c
enough	c
to	c
solve	c
this	c
issue	c
.	c

Conversely	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
arguments	c
which	c
contadict	i
it	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
trend	c
is	c
that	c
worldwide	i
proportion	i
of	c
unemployment	c
is	i
the	c
same	c
in	c
2014	c
and	c
2015	c
(	c
is	i
equal	i
5,9	c
percent	c
)	c
and	c
represent	i
the	c
middle	i
rate	c
of	c
unemployment	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
others	c
undreline	i
that	c
we	c
still	c
have	c
crimes	c
and	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
stop	c
because	c
of	c
prison	c
sentences	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
peoples	i
should	c
know	c
,	c
that	c
they	c
should	c
think	c
about	c
their	c
weight	c
and	c
sometimes	c
do	c
some	c
exercise	i
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
not	c
many	c
of	c
those	c
searchers	i
have	c
luck	c
on	c
their	c
sude	i
and	c
can	c
approach	i
to	i
that	c
understanding	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
a	c
huge	c
variety	c
of	c
cultures	c
,	c
ethnicities	c
,	c
languages	i
and	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
different	c
problems	c
which	c
is	i
complicated	c
to	c
solve	c
even	c
for	c
the	c
local	c
government	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
it	c
all	c
up	c
,	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
choice	c
of	c
everyone	c
either	c
to	c
reduce	c
the	c
using	c
of	c
the	c
results	c
of	c
modern	c
technologies	c
and	c
try	c
to	c
save	c
health	i
or	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

But	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
other	c
measures	c
can	c
be	c
suitable	i
too	c
.	c

The	c
graph	c

information	c
about	c

For	c

old	c
make	i
their	c
study	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
good	c
job	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
makes	c
things	c
worse	c
is	c
that	c
nobody	c
can	c
do	c
anything	c
with	c
this	c
problem	c

On	c
the	c
one	c

Concluding	c
,	c
the	c
difference	c
between	c
two	c
points	c
of	c
view	c
is	c
connected	c
with	c
the	c
economy	c
and	c
people	i
feelings	c

And	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
myself	c
try	c
to	c
get	c

bad	c
charactestics	i

Exploration	i

For	c
instance	c
,	c
metals	c
contain	i
more	c
than	c
a	c
third	c
in	c
a	i
whole	c
delivered	c
goods	c

whereas	c
it	i
's	i

The	c
charts	c

information	c
about	c
the	c
different	c
ages	c
of	c
the	c
populations	c
of	c
Yemen	c
and	c
Italy	c
in	c
2000	c
and	c
2050	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
mentioned	c
that	c
these	c
two	c
lines	c
on	c
each	i
graph	c
go	c
along	c
and	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
much	c
difference	c

I	c
mean	c
,	c
riots	c
,	c
wars	c
,	c
murders	c
and	c
so	c
on	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
more	c

for	c
the	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
we	i
can	c
see	c
that	c
facebook	i
is	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
social	c
network	c
among	i
the	c
chosen	c
ones	c
-	c
in	c
each	c
age	c
group	c
more	c
than	c
50	c
%	c
of	c
citizens	c
use	c
it	c
.	c

Another	c
argument	c
for	c
the	c
family	c
position	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
family	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
institution	c
available	c
to	c
the	c
child	c
in	c
the	c
early	c
forming	c
years	c
of	c
life	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
essential	c
core	c
skills	c
of	c
human	c
interaction	c
are	c
learned	c
and	c
main	c
values	c
established	c
,	c
both	c
determining	c
the	c
future	c
life	c
of	c
a	c
child	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
awareness	c
of	c
law	c
and	c
punishment	c
should	c
be	c
raised	c
.	c

Thus	i
in	c
2040	c
Japan	c
I	i
'd	i
expected	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
highest	c
proportion	c
of	c
their	c
population	c
(	c
about	c
27	c
%	c
)	c
,	c
the	c
second	c
position	c
has	i
Sweden	c
(	c
25	c
%	c
)	c
and	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
in	i
USA	c
with	c
nearly	c
23	c
%	c

Social	c
networks	c
have	c
become	c
an	c
important	c
part	c
of	c
everyone	c
's	c
everyday	c
life	c
,	c
thus	c
it	c
is	c
easy	c
to	c
manipulate	c
people	c
.	c

They	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
good	c
with	c
seryoznymi	i

A	c

In	c
conclusion	c

it	c
is	c
clearly	c

that	c

that	c

everybody	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
development	c
of	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
it	c

From	c
my	c
view	c
the	i
main	c
advantage	c
is	c
that	c

that	c

Another	c
argument	c
for	c

Nowadays	c

It	c

Others	c
believe	c

that	c

When	c

When	c
you	c

it	c
's	c
the	c

So	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
solution	c
of	c
health	c

in	i
our	i

.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	i
should	c
mentioned	i
that	c
temperature	c
significantly	i
increase	i
from	i

As	c
we	c
know	c
,	c
modern	i

has	c
such	c
examples	c
and	i
you	c
can	c
find	c
it	c
in	c

Secondly	c
,	c
each	c

should	c
be	c

all	c

industry	c

food	c
is	c
not	c
an	c
exception	c

It	c
looks	c
like	c
old	i
building	c
,	c
which	c
can	c
be	c
considered	c
as	c
a	c

of	c
our	c
cultural	c
heritage	c

People	c
often	c
use	c
it	c
at	c
work	c
and	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
all	c
opinions	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
find	c
the	c
best	c
solution	c

Moreover	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
a	c

Moreover	c
,	c
recieving	i
some	c
grants	c
from	c
their	c
leaders	c
teams	c
of	c
scientists	c
can	c
start	c
some	c

in	c
many	c

of	c
science	i
while	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
possible	c
for	c

of	c

As	c
a	c

it	c

that	c

To	c

For	c

In	c

both	c

Indeed	c
,	c
some	c

would	c
rather	c

to	c

from	c

play	c
an	c

in	c

,	c
from	c
their	c
friends	i
which	c
sometimes	c
are	c
closer	i
for	i

than	c

because	c
they	c
are	c
the	c

As	c
for	c
Yakutsk	c
,	c
Russia	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
maximum	c

have	c
the	c

As	c
the	c
medicine	c
develops	c
,	c
more	c
information	c
is	c
collected	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
always	c
important	c
to	c
remember	c
that	c
buildings	c
take	i
a	c
huge	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
reflection	c
of	c
the	c
city	c
and	c
country	i
and	c
it	i
can	c
also	c
represent	c
our	c
culture	i
so	c
with	c
all	c
modern	i
technologies	c
architects	i
can	c
easily	c
create	c
buildings	i
which	c
can	c
be	c
both	c
useful	c

The	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
from	c
that	c
year	c
the	c
difference	c
between	c
USA	i

Sweden	c
age	c

became	c
far	c
more	c
obvious	c
as	c
the	c
number	c
of	c

in	c

began	c
to	c

Secondly	c
,	c
an	i

By	c

absolutely	c

solution	c
is	c
to	c
have	c

only	c
significant	c
issue	c
is	c
about	c
women	c

Focusing	i

it	c
does	c
not	i

Unfortunetely	i

this	c
question	c
is	c
very	c
complicated	c

it	c
does	c
not	c
seem	c
possible	c

answerde	i
immediately	c

So	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c

the	c

might	c
be	c
accepted	c
and	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
some	c
of	c
materials	c
is	i
easier	c
to	c
transport	c
by	c

,	c
like	c
metals	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
useful	c
for	c
economic	i
of	c
this	i
country	c

The	c
average	c

World	i
accounts	c
for	c
5,9	i
which	i
remains	c
the	c
same	c
during	c
the	c
year	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
proportion	i
ca	c
n't	c
be	c

But	c
most	c
of	c
the	c

It	c
sounds	c
great	c
that	c
higher	c
education	c
is	c
opened	c
for	c
everyone	c
,	c
but	c
how	c
can	c
universities	c
keep	c
sex	c
balance	c
in	i
50/50	c
level	c
?	c

It	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
his	c
life	c
's	c
key	c
moments	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
starting	c
from	c
80	c
%	c
of	c
age	c
under	c
26	i
it	c
gradually	c
falls	c
down	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
sports	c
facilities	c
are	c
very	c
important	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
an	c
exellent	i
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
world	c
and	c
to	c
fond	i
out	c
what	c
you	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
in	c
life	c
.	c

To	c
my	c
mind	c
,	c
both	c
characteristics	c
are	c
important	c
for	c
our	c
existence	c
for	c
the	c
different	c
reasons	c
.	c

Overally	i
the	c
situation	c
will	c
change	c
in	c
both	c
countries	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
results	c
will	c
be	c
segnificantly	i
different	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
are	c
lots	c
of	c
ways	c
to	c
reduce	c
this	c
problem	c
.	c

The	c
key	c
difference	c
is	c
the	c
recognition	c
of	c
impact	c
of	c
characteristics	c
we	c
born	c
with	c
.	c

The	c
table	c
shows	c
that	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
children	c
of	c
both	c
sexes	c
who	c
did	c
regular	c
physical	c
activity	c
increased	c
from	c
1990	c
to	c
2005	c
:	c
from	c
51	c
%	c
to	c
77	c
%	c
for	c
boys	c
and	c
from	c
57	c
%	c
to	c
87	c
%	c
for	c
girls	c
;	c
and	c
in	c
general	c
girls	c
tended	c
to	c
excersise	i
more	c
than	c
boys	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
such	c
question	c
is	c
very	c
dabatable	i
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
may	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
support	c
the	c
opinion	c
described	c
in	c

,	c
this	c
idea	i
should	c
connect	i

and	c
what	c
this	c
electricity	c
is	c
used	c
for	c
in	c
England	c
respectively	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
significant	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
greatest	c
amount	c
of	c
books	c
of	c
any	c
type	c
is	c
produced	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c

It	c
was	c
followed	c

If	c
a	c
person	c
does	c
not	c
pay	c
enough	c
attention	c
to	c

it	c
can	c
lead	c
to	c
obesity	c

Firstly	c
,	c
importing	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
beneficial	c
for	c
the	c
importer	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
government	i
of	c
the	c
developed	c
countries	c
are	c
trying	c
to	c
encourage	c
appearance	c
of	c
small	c
businesses	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
two	c
extra	c
similarity	i
criterias	c
as	c
kilometres	i
of	c
route	c
and	c
quantity	c
of	c
passengers	c
per	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
most	c
popular	c
social	c
network	c
is	c
\"	i
Instagram	c
\"	i
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
the	c
main	c
purpose	c
is	c
to	c
reach	c
the	c
justice	c
in	c
the	c
process	c
of	c
restrictions	c
and	c
then	c
judge	c
what	c
this	c
restriction	c
will	c
be	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
evident	c
feature	c
in	c
chart	i
is	c
that	c
in	i
average	c
men	c
spend	c
more	c
time	c
doing	c
sport	c
in	c
England	c
than	c
women	c
do	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
that	c
import	c
and	c
export	c
are	c
crucial	c
parts	c
in	c
countries	c
economic	i
.	c

I	c
believe	c
only	c
more	c
effort	c
to	c
cooperate	c
and	c
communicate	c
with	c
young	c
people	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
way	c
to	c
solve	c
the	c
problem	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
no	c
doubt	c
that	c
nowaday	i
production	c
of	c
food	c
plays	c
an	c
important	c
role	c
in	c
economics	c
of	c
any	c
country	c
.	c

Second	i
thing	c
is	c
import	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
necessary	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
and	c
for	c
all	c
countries	c
to	c
help	c
each	c
other	c
with	c
food	c
.	c

Graph	i

in	c

it	c
will	c
be	c
around	c

The	c
rural	c
households	c
was	i
25	c

2003	c

and	c
then	c
it	c
was	c
more	c
popular	c

It	c
is	i
the	c
most	c
enormous	c
rate	c
in	c
this	c
sample	c

On	c
the	c

,	c
such	c
activities	c
as	c
paintings	c

should	c
be	c
do	i
according	c
to	c
the	c

of	c
the	c
country	c

because	c
they	c
can	c
destroy	c
the	c

it	c
is	c
expected	c
for	i

peaks	c
by	c
2040	c
at	c
23	c

and	c
25	c

On	c
the	c

addition	c
,	c

The	c
problem	c
of	c
copying	c

them	c
is	c
widespread	c

serious	c

as	c

a	c

they	c

n't	c
progress	i

Personally	c
,	c
i	i
am	c
sure	c
that	c
the	c
most	c
precious	i
influence	c
on	c
a	c
child	c
can	c
be	c
made	c
only	c
by	c
a	c

it	c

cheating	c

a	c
serious	c
crime	c

does	c

really	c

such	c
punishment	i
?	c

And	c
I'am	i
pretty	c
sure	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
nothing	c
as	c
important	c
for	c
a	c
human	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
reasons	c
why	c
disqualification	c
should	c
be	c
only	c
for	c
limited	c
period	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
nowadays	c
in	c
China	c
people	c
can	c
buy	c
vegetables	c
for	c
less	c
than	c
1	c

destroy	i
our	c
health	c

In	c
conclusion	c
we	i
can	c
say	c
that	c
creative	c
people	c
should	c
have	c
an	c
access	c
to	c
a	c
large	c
area	c
of	c
creativity	c
,	c
because	c
often	i
they	c
can	c
produce	i
a	c
masterpiece	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
huge	c

in	i

The	c
number	i
of	c

minutes	c
jumped	i
from	c
the	c
number	i

from	c

The	i
scientific	i
research	c
has	c
shown	c
that	c
people	c
are	c
known	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
preferable	i
to	c
the	i
good	c
-	c
looking	c

only	c
then	c
to	c
think	c
about	c

The	c

It	c
is	c
clear	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
trend	c
is	c
the	c
more	c
sophisticated	c
education	c
is	c
the	c
bigger	c
percentage	c
of	c
males	c
there	c
are	c

Thus	c
it	c
means	c
that	c
such	c
system	c
requires	c
increasing	c
taxes	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
affect	c
lower	c

Well	c

this	c
is	c
very	i

First	c

hope	i

way	c
to	c

this	c
is	c
to	c

Some	c
of	c
the	c
researches	c
show	c
that	c
the	c
crucial	c
points	c
are	c
the	c
parameters	c
we	c
have	i
when	c
we	c
were	c
just	c
born	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
space	c
programs	c
can	c
result	c
in	c
nothing	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
might	c
seem	c
like	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
situations	i
in	c
Yemen	c
and	c
Italy	c
do	c
not	c
look	c
pretty	c
same	i
and	c
gave	i
many	c
differences	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
have	c
a	c
possibility	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
membership	c
card	c
in	c
fitness	c
centres	c
but	i
they	c
do	c
not	c
do	c
it	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
lazy	c
and	c
prefer	c
to	i
watch	i
TV	c
or	c
play	i
computer	c
games	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
better	c
if	c
universities	c
accept	c
equal	c
numbers	c
of	c
males	c
and	c
females	c
,	c
because	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
scientists	c
say	c
that	c
interaction	c
between	c
males	c
and	c
females	c
is	c
much	c
for	c
social	c
and	c
psyhological	i
development	c
of	c
a	c
person	c
than	c
interaction	c
between	c
only	c

That	c

the	c
situation	c
have	i
changed	i
from	c

countries	c

Also	c
,	c
medical	c
education	c
should	c
be	c
more	c
popular	c
among	c
students	c
because	c
more	c
doctors	c
could	c
potentially	c
help	c
more	c
ill	c
people	c

You	c
always	c
keep	c
in	c

the	c

shows	c
us	c
a	c
really	c
unstable	c
situation	c

In	c
conclusion	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
public	c
health	c
improovement	i
is	c
only	c
possible	c
if	c
a	c
government	c
does	c
a	c
whole	c

of	c
things	c

such	c

I	c
was	c
paid	c

when	c
I	c
asked	c
her	c
what	c
if	c
it	c
was	c
important	c
for	c
her	c
if	c
the	i
building	c
was	c
beautiful	c

Moreover	c

influence	c
of	c
modern	c
movies	c
,	c
stresses	c
connected	c
with	c
reusing	i

a	c
computer	c

be	c
reduced	c
by	c
natural	c

The	c

a	c
crusial	i
theme	c
nowadays	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
government	c

are	c
ought	c
to	c
establish	c
fees	c
both	c
for	c
companies	c
who	c
spread	c
illegal	c

for	c
those	c

who	c

However	c
,	c
some	c
sport	c
fans	c
and	c
organisators	i
take	c
care	c
of	c
the	c
culture	c

with	c

giant	c
companies	c

a	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
everybody	c
decides	c
himself	i
,	c
if	c
he	c
wants	c
to	c
use	c
modern	c
technologies	c
or	c
they	i
are	c

with	i
the	i

it	c
is	c
duscused	i
that	c

should	c

students	c
in	c

There	c
is	c
no	c
any	i

despite	c

of	c

What	c
is	c

not	c
focuse	i
on	c
some	c
particular	c
areas	c

as	c

because	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
develop	c

for	c

it	c
can	c

I	c
am	c
inclined	c
to	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c

is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
start	c
going	c
to	c
gym	c
or	c

,	c
because	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
too	c
much	c
time	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
these	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	i

Novelties	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
real	c
to	c
reduce	c
these	c

After	c
that	c
they	c
can	c
go	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
always	c
everyone	c
's	c
personal	c
choice	c
in	c
which	c
way	c
to	c
develop	c
because	c
everything	c
is	c
possible	c

a	c

Nowadays	c
a	c

of	c

still	c

Modern	c

it	c

new	c
problems	c
appear	c

significant	i

of	c
them	c
are	i

In	c
2012	c
the	c

Also	c
it	c
helps	c
to	c
be	c

with	c
different	c
cultural	c
specialities	c
and	c
to	c
learn	c
some	c
foreign	c

This	c
causes	c

Everybody	c
likes	c
watching	c
films	c

I	c
agree	c
this	i
opinion	c
,	c
because	c
any	c
sports	c

is	c
good	i
thing	c
for	c
the	c
health	c
of	c

The	c
main	c
reason	c
why	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
is	c
because	c
illegar	i
drugs	c
can	c
help	c
athletes	c
to	c
achieve	c
success	c
in	c

much	c
better	c

The	c

In	c
1979	c
only	c
about	c
10	c

people	c
made	c

The	c
number	c
of	c

in	c
1990	c
was	c
350	c

which	c
then	c
dropped	c

Such	c

include	c
but	c
are	c
not	c

is	c
a	c

In	c
conclusion	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
notice	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
important	c
,	c
which	c

They	c
must	c

It	c
can	c

there	c

To	c
my	c
mind	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
so	c
,	c
as	c
every	c
time	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
glad	c
with	c
people	c
we	c
just	c
say	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
worth	c
to	i
mention	i
,	c
that	c
governments	c
should	c
work	i
not	c
only	c
in	i
their	c
own	c
districts	c
at	c
first	c
but	c
also	c
solve	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
problems	c
which	c
can	c
have	c
negative	c
implications	c

Some	c
people	c

If	c
one	c
country	c
restrict	c

something	c

it	c

some	c

As	c
a	c
result	c

people	c
can	c

When	i
the	c

was	c
about	c
1:2	c

But	c
at	c
first	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
think	c
,	c
if	c
he	c
really	c
wants	c
it	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
if	c
architects	c
can	c
create	c
a	c
mix	c
of	c
beuaty	i
and	c
functionality	c
,	c
there	i

going	c
to	c

the	c
best	c
the	c

have	c
ever	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
modern	c
people	c
have	i
n't	c
perfect	i
health	c
and	c
the	c
society	c
wants	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
improve	c
it	c
.	c

Essentially	c
,	c
girls	c
and	c
boys	c
had	i
become	i
more	c
overweight	c
during	c
the	c
given	c
period	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
the	i
amount	i
of	i
regular	i
physical	i
activity	i
had	c
increased	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
this	c
information	c
is	c
given	c
about	c
Yemen	c
and	c
Italy	c
.	c

In	c
Germany	c
and	c
China	c
,	c
the	c
development	i
of	c
prints	i

was	c
absolute	c

and	c
4,8	i
billion	c

in	c
China	c
,	c
respectively	c

After	c
that	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
logical	c
to	c
give	c
this	c
person	c
a	c
second	c
chance	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
believe	c
that	c
such	c
a	c
measure	c
can	c
help	c
to	c

Here	c
both	c
monitoring	c
the	c

may	c
work	c
as	c
the	c
push	c
for	c

commities	i
to	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
rational	c
to	c
give	c
them	c
as	c
many	c
places	c
in	c

as	c

have	c
when	c
it	c

in	c
the	c

can	c

Meanwhile	c
EU	i
has	c
another	c
trend	c
that	c
changes	i
the	c
conclusive	c

of	c
the	c
research	c

But	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
support	c
him	c

It	c
means	c
that	c
more	c
than	c
half	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
adult	c
in	c
2050	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
are	c
sure	c
,	i
that	c
everything	c
depends	c
on	c
us	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
everywhere	c
:	c
on	c
the	c

However	c
,	c
it	i
was	c
also	c
chosen	c
by	c
two	c
other	c
age	c
groups	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
,	i
that	c
if	c
person	c
understands	c
the	c
problem	c
and	c
wants	c
to	c
solve	c
it	c
,	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
can	c
do	c
this	c
.	c

In	c
cold	c
Russian	c
weather	c
it	c
is	c
unpractical	c
,	i
because	c
they	c
can	c
become	c
even	c
more	c
ill	c

Maximum	c
temperature	c
in	c
Rio	c
de	c

is	c
between	c
+25	c

+30	c
degrees	c
approximately	c
.	c

Others	c
suppose	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
destroy	c
the	c
education	i
system	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
,	c
people	c
who	c
lacked	c
love	c
and	c
care	c
in	c
their	c
childhood	c
are	c
more	c
likely	c
to	c
become	c
criminals	c
.	c

Overall	c
,	c
we	c
may	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
USA	c
have	c
the	c
most	c
developed	c
book	c
market	c
of	c
all	c
four	c
countries	c
,	c
in	c
terms	c
of	c
billions	c
of	c
US	c
Dollars	c
.	c

As	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
from	c
the	c
graph	c
,	c
the	c
similar	c
tendency	c
is	i
in	c
Latin	c
America	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
contrast	c
,	c
Middle	i
East	i
and	c
Latin	c
America	c
characterize	i
with	c
more	c
unemployment	i
people	c
in	c
2014	c
than	c
in	c
2015	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
it	c
all	c
up	c
,	c
in	c
megapolises	i
creation	i
of	c
beautiful	c
buildings	c
does	c
not	c
play	c
an	c
important	c
role	c
.	c

All	c
in	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
worth	c
trying	c
to	c
increase	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
sports	c
facilities	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
such	c
kind	c
of	c
discrimination	c
in	c
Reich	c
.	c

As	c
we	c
can	c
observe	c
,	c
the	c
half	c
of	c
population	c
of	i
Yemen	c
consisted	c
of	c
young	c
people	c
from	c
0	c
to	c
14	c
years	c
old	c
in	c
2000	c
,	c
while	c
in	c
Italy	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
youngsters	c
were	i
remarkably	c
lower	c
(	c
14,3	c
%	c
of	c
population	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
following	c
these	c
advices	i
can	c
improv	i
studying	c
and	c
teaching	c
,	c
make	c
them	c
more	c
attractive	c
for	c
both	c
sides	c
.	c

It	i
is	c
really	c
difficult	c
problems	c
to	c
be	c
solved	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
it	i
is	i
impossible	i
sometimes	c
to	i
find	c
an	c
equal	c
amount	i
of	c
both	c
:	i
men	c
and	c
women	c
,	i
and	c
prompt	c
them	c
to	c
study	c
together	c
.	c

People	c
claim	c
that	c
affordable	c
and	c
conviently	i
situated	c
sport	c
facilities	c
is	c
a	c
solution	c
for	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
public	c
health	c
problems	c
.	c

Many	c
people	c
claim	c
that	c
this	c
approach	c
has	c
a	c
positive	c
effect	c
on	c
scientific	c
reasearch	i
while	c
others	c
disagree	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

A	c
second	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
they	c
destroy	c
their	c
health	c
.	c

They	c
can	c
live	i
enjoying	i
without	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
but	c
with	c
their	c
closest	c
people	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
many	c
resources	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
teachers	c
can	c
invite	c
former	c
criminals	c
to	c
share	c
their	c
negative	c
experience	c
and	c
the	c
outcome	c
of	c
committing	c
crimes	c
.	c

The	c
number	c
of	c
teenagers	c
who	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
crimes	c
is	c
getting	c
bigger	c
every	c
year	c
.	c

An	c
athelet	i
could	c
consider	c
that	c
as	c
a	c
punishment	c
and	c
understand	c
that	c
this	c
his	c
act	c
migh	i
be	c
valued	c
as	c
a	c
crime	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
work	c
of	c
musicians	c
and	c
film	c
producers	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
second	c
part	c
in	i
our	c
life	c
we	c
contact	c
with	c
a	c

In	c
conclusion	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
all	c
in	c
all	i
this	c

indicates	c
rather	i
positive	c

Facebook	c

the	c
major	c

that	i
are	i

As	c
illustrated	c
from	i
the	c

the	c

be	c

In	i
this	i
way	i
,	c
government	c
wasted	c
a	i
lot	c
of	c
money	i
to	i
transportation	c
and	c
other	c
aspects	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
oppinion	i
and	c
I	c
give	c
some	c
reason	i
for	c
and	c
against	c
.	i

It	c
might	c
be	c
beneficial	c
to	c
scientists	c
at	c
an	c
individual	c
level	c
,	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
paid	c
better	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
a	c
global	c
level	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
good	c
for	c
scientific	c
development	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
government	c
of	c
south	c
country	c
provides	c
a	c
comfortable	c
and	c
convience	i
residence	c
for	c
hockey	c
,	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
mean	c
that	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
sports	c
will	c
be	c
popular	c
in	c
this	c
country	c
.	c

But	c
if	c
Yemen	c
labour	c
market	c
will	c
grow	c
because	c
of	c
increasing	c
of	c
people	c
fifteen	i
to	c
sixty	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
the	c
situation	c
in	c
Italy	c
is	c
completely	c
opposite	c
because	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
retired	c
people	c
is	c
already	c
significantly	c
bigger	c
and	c
tend	i
to	c
grow	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
modern	c
technologies	c
are	c
friends	c
of	c
human	c
beings	c
.	c

The	c
proof	c
to	c
my	c
words	c
could	c
be	c
the	c
apartment	c
blocks	c
of	c
the	c
same	c
type	c
built	c
all	c
over	c
USSR	c
in	c
the	c
sixties	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
it	i
given	c
us	c
more	c
horrible	c
illness	i
like	c
mental	c
problem	i
,	c
obesity	c
and	c
another	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
because	c
of	c
these	c
highly	c
important	c
early	c
years	c
spent	c
with	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

Parents	i
and	i
teachers	i
with	i
love	c
,	c
support	c
and	c
education	i
can	i
make	c
a	c
tremendous	c
step	c
on	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
the	c
solution	c
of	c
the	c
problem	c
and	c
if	i
participated	i
by	c
the	c
government	i
-	i
can	c
be	c
really	c
effective	c
in	c
decreasing	c
crime	c
rates	c
among	c
youngsters	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
available	c
opportunity	c
to	c
fix	c
this	c
problem	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
interesting	c
to	c
notice	i
that	c
more	c
than	c
a	c
half	c
of	c
students	i
,	c
refered	i
to	c
18	c

25	i

are	c
tend	c
to	c

science	c
cource	i
amongst	i
this	i

is	i
the	i
most	i
popular	i
than	i
Arts	i

Sports	i
all	i
together	i
,	c
whereas	c
the	c
audience	c
of	c
26	c

40	i
year	i
olds	c
like	c
Sports	c
and	c
Health	c

more	c
than	c
other	c
ones	c
and	c
their	c
percentage	i
achieves	c
to	i
62	c
per	c

.	c

It	i
can	c
be	c
noticed	c
a	c
medium	c
increase	c
in	c
population	c
of	c
15	c
-	c
59	c

Moveover	i
,	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c

Firstly	c
,	c
let	c
is	i
summarize	c
the	c
information	c
about	c
goods	c
,	c
which	c
transported	c
by	c
rail	c
.	c

Temperature	i
in	c
Brazil	c
remain	i
stable	c
with	c
some	c
fluctuations	c
,	c
within	c
whole	c
year	c
.	c

In	c
secondary	c
school	c
there	c
are	i
various	i
of	c
difficult	c
and	c
complicated	c
subject	i
,	c
for	c
instance	i
chemistry	i
and	c
physics	c
,	c
which	c
requares	i
all	c
time	i
to	i
be	c
learn	i
properly	c
.	c

Another	c
noticeable	c
trend	c
is	c
a	c
low	c
rate	c
of	c
unemployment	c
in	c
South	c
Asia	c
.	c

Concerning	c
Instagram	c
,	c
it	c
takes	c
the	c
second	c
place	c
only	c
due	c
to	c
young	c
generation	c
-	c
53	c
%	c
.	c

They	c
should	c
limit	c
the	c
time	c
,	i
children	c
spend	c
using	c
their	c
gadgets	c
.	c

Another	c
do	i
not	c
forget	i
that	c
is	i
more	i
better	c
to	c
be	c
happy	c
,	i
than	c
tell	c
everybody	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
not	c
do	c
something	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
maybe	c
Universities	i
should	c
accept	c
equal	c
number	c
of	c
students	c
in	c
every	c
subject	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
it	c
is	c
predicted	c
that	c
the	c
absolute	c
leader	c
of	c
the	c
proportion	c
of	c
population	c
aged	c
65	c
and	c
over	c
will	c
be	c
Japan	c
at	c
the	c
level	c
of	c
30	c
%	c
,	c
then	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
Sweden	c
with	c
its	c
25	c
%	c
,	c
and	c
how	i
it	c
sounds	c
strange	c
,	c
America	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
last	c
.	i

Some	c
actions	c
are	c
done	i
by	c
the	c
government	c
to	c
prevent	c
the	c
\"	c
pirate	c
business	c
\"	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
still	c
widespreaded	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
also	c
will	c
try	c
to	c
prove	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
11	c
kilometres	c
in	c
length	c
,	c
so	c
the	c
Kyoto	c
's	c
metro	c
is	c
the	c
smallest	c
one	c
.	c

In	c
universities	c
few	i
kinds	c
of	c
programs	c
can	c
be	c
more	c
popular	c
among	c
the	c
male	c
group	c
and	c
other	c
kinds	i
among	c
the	c
female	c
group	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
UK	c
has	c
nearly	c
the	c
eaquel	i
incomes	c
from	c
eBooks	c
and	c
printed	c
books	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
a	c
persond	i
should	c
find	c
his	c
perfect	i
balance	c
between	c
taking	c
extra	c
working	c
hours	c
and	c
leisure	c
time	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
our	c
instincts	c
dictate	c
us	c
to	c
follow	c
these	c
steps	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
nature	c
never	c
lies	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
notion	c
can	c
hardly	c
be	c
defined	c
,	c
because	c
different	c
people	c
tend	c
to	c
anderstand	i
it	c
differently	c
.	c

Thus	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
as	c
clear	c
danger	c
for	c
political	c
stability	c
of	c
a	c
country	c
if	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
some	c
soirt	i
of	c
revolution	c
sporeads	i
via	c
publicly	c
acesible	i
objects	c
like	c
pictures	c
,	c
music	c
or	c
films	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
glance	c
it	c
is	c
clear	c
that	c
there	c
is	i
not	c
a	c
dawnward	i
trend	c
in	c
the	c
reduction	c
of	c
unemployment	c
rate	c
in	c
all	c
regions	c
.	c

The	c
pie	c
charts	c
show	c
that	c
there	c
are	i
good	c
transported	c
by	c
rail	c
and	c
by	c
road	c
in	c
Eeastern	i
Europe	c
in	c
2008	c
.	c

They	c
should	c
find	c
a	c
balance	c
between	c
dream	c
and	c
reality	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
such	c
system	c
will	c
work	c
perfectly	c
,	i
if	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
well	c
-	c
organized	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
they	c
may	c
have	i
some	c
extra	c
points	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
while	c
working	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
all	c
children	c
study	c
at	c
school	c
where	c
they	c
take	i
knowledge	c
in	c
different	c
spheres	c
of	c
life	c
and	i
after	c
it	i
they	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
it	c
in	c
real	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
way	c
we	c
can	c
surely	c
point	c
out	c
the	c
parents	c
'	c
influence	c
on	c
children	c
rather	c
then	i
outside	c
world	c
's	c
one	c

He	c
or	c

In	c
general	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
tendency	i
to	i
decreace	i
of	c

In	c

Overall	c
,	c
the	c
diffferences	i
between	c
two	i
countries	c
'	c
employment	c
sectors	c
are	c
obious	i
and	c
this	c
can	c
be	c
explained	c
by	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
factors	c
,	c
including	c
historical	c
background	c
,	c
gepgraphical	i
position	c
and	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
's	c
political	c
arena	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
government	c
is	c
very	c
strickt	i
about	c
protecting	c
the	c
national	c
companies	c
,	c
it	c
affects	c
customers	c
.	c

They	c
do	c
n't	c
talk	c
enough	c
to	c
their	c
children	c
,	c
so	c
teenagers	c
get	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
experiences	c
from	c
their	c
friends	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
musicians	c
and	c
actors	c
get	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
because	c
they	c
give	c
concerts	c
or	c
producers	c
pat	i
them	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

Another	c
reason	c
of	c
those	c
crimes	c
is	c
lack	c
of	c
opportunities	c
.	c

This	c

consists	i
of	i

This	c

is	c
very	c
important	c
nowadays	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
both	c
types	c
of	c
buildings	c
are	c
significant	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
to	c
exclude	c
beauty	i
in	i
architecture	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
why	c
it	c
is	c
vital	c
to	c
develop	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

As	c
an	c
example	c
I	c
may	i
suggest	c
various	c
charity	c
programms	i
organized	c
on	c

Besides	c

It	c
is	c
evident	c
from	c

Therefore	c
,	c
the	c
ability	c
to	c
find	c
investors	c
is	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
this	c
business	c

That	c
is	c
why	c

Also	c
,	c
the	c
freedom	c
provide	i

It	c
is	c
a	c
well	c
-	c
known	c
fact	c
that	c
watching	c
TV	c
and	c
playing	c

games	c
leads	c
to	c
increased	c
violence	c
among	c
people	c

To	c
be	c
more	c
precise	c
,	c
it	i
was	i
spent	c
about	c
2.6	c

1.8	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
suppose	c
it	c
that	c
they	c
have	c
their	i
own	i
right	c
to	c

any	c
subject	c
they	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
obvious	c
that	c
travelling	c

is	c
much	c
more	c
convenient	c
than	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
by	c
car	c
or	c
by	c
train	c
.	c

Summarizing	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
said	c
that	c
men	c
in	c
average	c
were	c
more	c
likely	c
to	c
get	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
post	c
-	c
school	c
qualification	c
than	c
women	c
and	c
this	c
tendency	c
was	c
n't	c
observed	c
only	c
among	c
the	c
undergraduate	c
diplomas	c

owners	c

Nowadays	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
problem	c
of	c
a	c
proper	c
balance	c
between	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
and	c
a	i
good	c
salary	c
oppotrunities	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
government	c
should	c
give	c
artists	c
enough	c
freedom	c
,	c
but	c
sometimes	c
it	c
also	c
can	c
restrict	c
their	c
activities	c
to	c
save	c
the	c
public	c
order	c
in	c
the	c
country	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
chart	c
shows	c
,	c
90	c

In	c
this	c
essay	c
I	c
will	c
discuss	c
this	c
issue	c
,	c
provide	c
some	c
examples	c
and	c
draw	c
a	c
conclusion	c

And	c
bad	c

Choose	c
approximately	c
50	c

As	c
a	c
solution	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
make	c
lessons	c
less	c
strict	c
,	c
because	c
sometimes	c
when	c
you	c
're	c
told	c

you	c

you	c

to	c
do	c
right	c
the	c
opposite	c

In	c
Indonesia	c
it	i
is	c
about	c
49	c
%	c
,	c
whereas	c
in	c
Australia	c
it	c
reaches	c
88	c
%	c
.	c

While	c
the	c
same	c
sector	c
in	c
Australia	c
shows	c
the	c
tendency	c
of	c
women	c
to	c
be	c
employed	c
in	c
services	c
sector	c
(	c
88	c
%	c
)	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
percenatage	i
it	i
is	c
higher	i
23	c
%	c
than	i
male	c
employment	c
(	c
65	c
%	c
)	c
in	c
2010	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
enough	c
important	c
for	c
their	c
future	c
adults	c
life	c
.	c

Also	i
a	c
big	c
feature	c
is	c
near	c
food	c
products	c
,	c
because	c
percent	i

transported	c
by	c
rail	c
is	c
smaller	c
than	c
percents	i
of	c
food	c
transported	c
by	c
road	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
difficult	c
economic	c
's	i
conditionals	c
lead	c
to	c
increasing	c
number	c
of	c
young	c
adults	c
jointed	i
in	c
crime	c
structure	c
and	c
lack	c
of	c
special	c
places	c
for	c
walking	c
,	c

leads	c
to	c
a	c
big	c
percentage	c
of	c
children	c
who	c
start	c
communicate	i
with	c
crimes	i

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
motivates	c
a	c
singer	c
of	c
a	c
film	c
director	c
to	c
make	c
more	c
films	c
or	c
organize	c
more	c
concerts	c
to	c
show	c
new	c
pieces	i
of	c

Most	c
of	c
all	c

This	c
essay	c
proves	c
that	c
technologies	c
cause	c
many	c
health	c
problems	c
today	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
convinced	c
that	c
this	c
method	c
is	c
not	c
effective	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
place	c
had	c
Sweden	c
with	c
about	c
7	c
%	c
and	c
Japan	c
was	c
next	c
with	c
5	c
%	c
of	c
total	c
population	c

Also	i
people	c
believe	c
that	c
architects	c
has	i
not	c
reasons	c
to	c
worry	c
about	c
building	c
constructions	c
that	c
are	c
works	c
of	c
art	c
.	c
I	c
support	c
the	c
idea	c
,	i
that	c
the	c
look	c
and	c
the	c
purpose	c
of	c
the	i
buildings	c
and	c
constructions	c
are	c
equally	c
important	c
,	i
because	c
people	c
like	c
watching	i
stunning	c
and	c
fascinating	c
objects	c
,	c
also	c
the	c
appearance	c
of	c
many	c
things	c
attracts	c
our	c
attention	c

Percentage	c
of	c
the	c
population	c
aged	c
15	c

19	c
years	c
grew	c
up	c
to	c
53,7	c
%	c
for	i
this	c
fifty	c
years	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
trend	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
female	c
and	c
male	i
work	c
in	c
services	i
sector	c
in	c
both	c
counties	i
.	c

Because	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
your	c
surrounding	i
,	c
you	c
're	c
not	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
happy	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
said	c
that	c
modern	c
technologies	c
are	c
totally	c
harmless	c
and	c
ca	i
n't	i
lead	c
to	c
any	c
illness	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
how	c
may	c
the	c
results	c
of	c
exams	c
be	c
honest	i
if	c
director	i
of	c
universities	c
would	c
take	c
students	c
only	c
for	i
proportional	c
criteria	c
?	c

The	c
main	c
trend	c
that	c
emerges	c
from	c
the	c
charts	c
is	c
that	c
heavy	c
goods	c
mainly	i
transported	c
by	c
rail	c
(	c
like	c
Machinery	c
and	c
Metals	c
)	c
and	i
small	c
goods	c
transported	i
by	c
road	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
food	i
products	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
even	c
possible	c
that	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
civilians	c
,	c
as	c
opposed	c
to	c
scientists	c
,	c
will	c
find	c
new	c
ways	c
of	c
doing	c
some	c
things	c
or	c
even	c
make	c
a	c
major	c
discovery	c
,	c
thus	c
causing	c
their	c
names	c
to	c
be	c
forever	i
remembered	c
.	i

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
reckon	c
that	c
environment	i
is	c
more	c
important	c
then	i
genes	c
,	c
since	c
even	c
slight	i
change	c
in	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
followed	c
by	c
a	c
great	c
change	c
in	c
one'a	i
personality	c
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
people	c
are	c
eager	c
to	c
try	c
something	c
new	c
,	c
and	c
to	c
try	c
a	c
new	c
ganre	i
of	c
music	c
they	c
schould	i
spend	c
a	c

while	c
people	c

just	c

Today	c
we	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
century	c
,	i
where	c
the	c
information	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
expensive	c
thing	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
can	c
have	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
obvious	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
first	c
graph	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
greatest	c
amount	c
of	c

by	c

in	c

In	c

So	i
in	c
the	c
country	c
should	i
be	c
huge	i
variaty	c
of	c
sports	c
that	c
people	c
can	c

The	c
less	c

It	c
is	c
clear	c
that	c
from	c
1700	c
till	c
1800	c
two	i
lines	c
were	c
going	c
together	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
at	c
high	c
level	c
,	c
so	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
births	c
and	c
deaths	c
were	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
even	c
countries	c
which	c
one	c

was	c
the	c
one	c
or	c
are	c
simply	c
situated	c

imported	c

of	c

Moreother	i
there	c
is	c
a	c
huge	c
difference	c
between	c

I	c
have	c
three	c
reasons	c
to	c
disagree	c
with	c
this	c
topic	i
.	c

Taking	i
all	i
the	i
data	i
into	i
consideration	i
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
noted	c
that	c
the	c
non	c
-	c
white	c
population	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
prevalent	c
,	c
while	c
in	c
the	c
UK	c
the	c
population	i
mainly	c
consists	c
of	c
whites	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
the	c
appearance	c
of	c
the	c
biuldings	i
is	c
essential	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
recognised	c
as	c
stealing	c
money	c
and	c
labour	c
from	c
artists	c
which	i
is	c
also	c
illegal	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
ways	c
to	c
solve	c
this	c
problem	c
is	c
to	c
give	c

In	c

the	c
town	c

as	c
well	c
as	c
strengthen	c
the	c
connection	c
of	c
the	c
citizens	c
to	c
their	c

ensuring	c
that	c
they	c
do	c
not	c

to	c
another	c

and	c
continue	c
working	c
and	c
living	c
where	c
they	c
were	c
born	c
.	c

From	c
all	c
the	c
above	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
architects	c
should	c
worry	c
about	c
the	c
producinf	i
of	c
a	c
bulding	i
as	c
the	i
work	c
of	c
art	c

A	c
similar	c
tendancy	i
can	c
be	c
observed	c
for	c
machinery	c

Talanted	i
people	c
who	c
bring	c
their	c
own	c
ideas	c
for	c
world	c
aproximately	i
changed	c
our	c
history	c
.	c

Government	c
should	c
reduce	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
sites	c
,	i
that	c
exists	i
today	c
.	c

The	c
latest	c
date	c
of	c
systems	i
open	c
is	c
in	c
Los	c
Angeles	c
in	c
2001	c
.	c

The	c
least	c
change	c
has	i
happened	i
to	c
the	c
sphere	c
of	c
education	c
where	c
the	c
numbers	c
stayed	c
almost	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
Japan	c
inspite	i
of	c
island	c
location	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
developed	c
countries	c
not	c
only	c
in	c
food	c
industry	c
.	c

Technological	c
progress	c
allows	c
us	c
buy	i
more	c
and	c
more	c
safety	i
things	c
,	c
which	c
have	c
no	c
bad	c
influence	c
on	c
people	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
in	c
small	c
Russian	c
villages	c
it	c
is	c
far	c
better	c
to	c
build	c
a	c
chain	c
store	c
of	c
large	c
international	c
brand	c
than	c
local	i
family	i
shop	i
,	c
as	c
citizens	c
will	c
get	c
more	c
working	c
places	c
with	c
higher	c
salaries	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
completely	c
disagree	c
with	c
this	c
statement	c
,	c
because	c
nowadays	c
many	c
countries	c
just	c
can	c
not	c
produce	c
enough	c
food	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
import	c
one	i
from	c
other	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
universities	c
should	c
practise	c
this	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
this	c
situation	c
can	c
be	c
equal	c
to	c
robbery	c
which	i
is	c
illegal	c
all	c
over	c
the	c

Taking	c
everything	c

that	c
by	c

people	c

these	c
industries	c
block	c
themselves	c

it	c

What	c
I	c
mean	c
is	c
that	c
the	c

Another	c

is	c
the	c

a	i

a	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
young	c
people	c
are	c
influenced	c
by	c
those	c

they	c
also	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
an	c
opportunity	c
for	c
all	c

to	c
study	c
the	c
subject	c
as	i
a	c

must	c
be	c
openminded	i
and	c
develop	c
every	c

Nowadays	c
people	c
are	c
fully	c
engaged	c
not	c
only	c
in	c
personal	c
but	c
also	c
in	c
economic	c
issues	c

The	c
popularity	c
of	c
illegal	c
drugs	c
in	c
the	c

is	c
growing	c
nowadays	c

Others	c
would	c
debate	c
that	c
the	c
development	c
of	c
online	c
means	c
of	c
commercial	i
does	c
not	c
decline	i
the	c
system	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
70	c

of	c
men	c
who	c
had	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
situation	c
with	c
unemployment	c
people	c
is	c
under	c
control	c
and	c
does	c
n't	c
make	c
sharp	c

The	c
longest	c
periods	c

2020	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
the	i
high	i
rise	c
of	c
the	c

population	c

These	c
countries	c
do	c
n't	c
tend	c
to	c
have	c
such	c
significant	c
increase	c
as	c
Japan	c
has	c

People	c
's	c
homes	c
are	c
robbed	c
,	c
many	c
women	c
get	c
mugged	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
gender	c
should	c
not	c
play	c
an	c
important	c
role	c
when	c
you	c
apply	i
for	i
university	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
glow	i
of	c

and	c

In	c
contrast	c
the	i
biggest	c
part	c
is	c
different	c
and	c
changes	c
from	c

of	c

A	c
closer	c
look	c
at	c

that	c

going	c

while	c
the	c
number	c

has	i
more	c
than	c
doubled	c

Another	c
reasn	i

as	c

In	i
oppozite	i
about	c
70	c

diploma	c
,	i
and	c
just	c
40	c
percent	c
of	c
men	c
hold	i
this	c
qualifications	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
,	c
having	i
already	c
managerial	i
experience	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
confidently	c
say	c
that	c
a	c
work	c
group	c
brings	c
higher	c
result	i
while	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
sex	c
disbalance	i
.	c

But	c
the	c
results	c
of	c
this	c
decision	c
are	c
not	c
so	c
evident	c
.	c

This	c
essay	c
will	c
outline	c
both	c
views	c
and	c
end	c
up	c
with	c
personal	i
opinion	c
.	c

In	c
1995	c
Japan	c
still	c
holded	i
it	c
's	i
position	c
,	c
also	c
the	c
difference	c
made	i
only	c
30	c
%	c
then	c
.	c

Thus	c
I	c
would	c
consider	c
it	c
absurd	c
,	c
moreover	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
see	c
any	c
reasons	c
to	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
statement	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
most	c
upword	i
trend	c
for	c
man	i
was	c
skilled	c
vocational	c
diploma	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
90	c
%	c
,	c
whereas	c
the	c
most	c
upword	i
trend	c
for	c
women	c
was	c
undergraduate	c
diploma	c
(	c
70	c
per	c

)	c
.	c

Let	c
us	c
investigate	c
this	c
problem	c
.	c

In	c
2015	c
it	c
was	c
9,6	c
%	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
this	c
logic	i
people	c
of	c
all	c
the	i

should	c
only	c
eat	c
what	c
their	c

Nevetheless	i

the	c
